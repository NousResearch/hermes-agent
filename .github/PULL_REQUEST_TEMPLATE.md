## Verification Evidence

<!-- Show your verification. Test output, before/after logs, screenshots from debug runs,
     profiling traces — anything a reviewer can inspect without running your branch.
     If tests produce output, paste it here. For performance changes, include timings. -->

<!-- Example: Before the fix, non-Bedrock provider listing emitted botocore timeout traces
     for http://169.254.169.254. Targeted test run: 38 passed. Full suite: 19093 passed
     (28 pre-existing failures listed below, none in touched files). -->
