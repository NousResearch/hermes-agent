# Rabbit Agent - Development Guide

For AI coding assistants and developers working on rabbit-agent. This root file is a hub: what
applies everywhere, then a routing table. Each area's `AGENTS.md` loads automatically when you work
in that directory; read it before editing there. `python scripts/check` caps this file at 12k chars
and every root-to-area chain at 30k, so it loads whole on 128k+ models: long form goes in the guide.

**Never give up on the right solution.**

## What Rabbit Is

Rabbit is a personal AI agent that runs the same agent core across a CLI, a messaging
gateway (Telegram, Discord, Slack, ~20 platforms), a TUI, and an Electron desktop app. It
learns across sessions (memory + skills), delegates to subagents, runs scheduled jobs, and
drives a real terminal and browser. It is extended primarily through **plugins and skills**,
not by growing the core.

Two invariants shape almost every design decision and are the lens for reviewing any change:

- **Per-conversation prompt caching is sacred.** Mutating past context, swapping toolsets,
  reloading memories or rebuilding the system prompt mid-conversation breaks the cached prefix and
  multiplies the user's cost; the ONE exception is context compression. Slash commands that change
  system-prompt state defer to the next session, with an opt-in `--now` (`/skills install --now`).
- **The core is a narrow waist; capability lives at the edges.** Every model tool is sent on
  every API call, so the bar for a new *core* tool is high. New capability should arrive as a
  CLI command + skill, a service-gated tool, or a plugin — not as core surface.

## Contribution rubric

The project's intent layer, for contributors and for the triage sweeper (which may only close on
`implemented_on_main`, `cannot_reproduce` or `incoherent`; taste-based closes are a maintainer's
call, and when in doubt a PR stays open). Long form with examples:
`website/docs/developer-guide/contributing.md` § Contribution rubric.

**Wanted:** real bug fixes (repro on `main`, the exact line, the whole class incl. sibling paths);
reach at the edges (adapters, providers, models, UI features) wired into the existing setup UX;
god-file → module refactors; extending before duplicating (3+ PRs in one category → an ABC +
orchestrator); behaviour-contract tests; E2E with real imports against a temp `RABBIT_HOME` for
resolution, config, security and I/O changes; salvage by cherry-pick so authorship survives.

**Rejected even when well-built:** hooks with no concrete consumer; new `RABBIT_*` env vars for
non-secret config (`.env` is secrets only, behaviour goes in `config.yaml`); a new core tool when
terminal + file or a skill already does the job; `offset`/`limit` pagination on instructional tools;
"fixes" that destroy the feature they secure; outbound telemetry without an opt-in gate;
change-detector tests; plugins that touch core files; third-party products in the core tree (ship a
standalone plugin repo).

**Before you call it a bug,** verify the claim AND the intent (`git log -p -S "<symbol>"`): the
isolation is often the design (profiles are islands on purpose), an absence can be load-bearing,
and a fix that cannot point to the line where the bug manifests has an unverified premise.

**Security:** `SECURITY.md` is the scope authority. A §3.1 finding goes private (GitHub Security
Advisories or https://github.com/seven0070/Rabbit-/security/advisories/new), never into a public issue, PR, commit or comment; §3.2
hardening is ordinary public work. Name the §2 boundary crossed, with a repro on `main`.

**Footprint ladder** (take the highest rung that solves it): extend existing code → CLI command +
skill → service-gated tool (`check_fn` answers reachability/opt-in, never per-session surface:
`tools/AGENTS.md`) → plugin → MCP server in the catalog → new core tool (fundamental, broadly useful,
unreachable otherwise).

## Development Environment

`source ./activate` (fish: `activate.fish`, PowerShell: `activate.ps1`) provisions and activates the
PM environment; pick an isolated `RABBIT_HOME`/`RABBIT_RUNTIME_DIR` first
(`website/docs/reference/package-management.md#developer-workflow`). Tests need the separate test
environment in `CONTRIBUTING.md`. **`python scripts/check`** runs every blocking lint check CI
runs, with CI's pinned tools; `--install-hook pre-push` runs it on every push (re-run after
pulling to refresh the hook). `# noqa` does not waive a ratchet finding:
`# health: allow <RULE> -- <why>` does.

## Project Structure

Counts shift constantly; the filesystem is canonical. Load-bearing entry points:

```

```

**User state:** `~/.rabbit/config.yaml` (settings), `.env` (secrets only), `logs/` (`rabbit logs`);
all profile-aware via `get_rabbit_home()`.

### Facade + siblings layout

Every former god file is a **facade** (public entry points + the names other packages import) plus
**siblings** `<stem>_<topic>.py`, each owning one topic (`rabbit_state.py`, `gateway/run.py`,
`tools/mcp_tool.py`, `rabbit_cli/kanban.py`, `rabbit_cli/web_server.py`, `cli.py` →
`rabbit_cli/cli_*_mixin.py`, `run_agent.py` → `agent/turn_*.py`).

- **Find code by topic:** `grep -rn "def name" <dir>/<stem>_*.py`, not by reading the facade.
- **Siblings late-import the facade** inside functions; never a module-level cycle.
- **Patch where production reads:** a sibling doing `from <facade> import name` inside the function
  makes the facade the seam; a patch on the defining module passes silently.
- **Size and complexity are ratcheted per unit** (`scripts/code_health/config.py`): new functions
  CC ≤ 20, ≤ 300 lines, nesting ≤ 6; files ≤ 2,000 lines; units already over may only go down (move
  a function into a sibling to offset growth, or put new tests in a new test file). Behaviour goes
  in a sibling, never a facade; name ladders become a dict → handler.
- **No re-export shims for internal moves;** internal paths are not API. Moving a symbol means
  fixing its docs in the same PR (grep `website/docs`, `skills/`, every `AGENTS.md`).

## Rules that apply everywhere

- **No defensive clutter:** no wrappers or `try/except: pass` around code that cannot fail, no flags
  nobody sets, no dead code wired in without E2E proof. Comments keep the WHY, cut the WHAT.
- **Never infer process identity from argv substrings;** use
  `gateway.status.looks_like_gateway_command_line` / `rabbit_cli.update_cmd._rabbit_holder_subcommand`
  (HX003; details `rabbit_cli/AGENTS.md`).
- **Never hardcode `~/.rabbit`:** `get_rabbit_home()` for paths, `display_rabbit_home()` for text
  (HX001). `_get_profiles_root()` is HOME-anchored on purpose.
- **One process serves many profiles.** Code that runs outside a turn (boot probes, eviction,
  tickers, deferred callbacks, RPC methods, thread hops, child spawns) binds the owning profile scope
  explicitly; `os.environ`, module globals and import-time values hold the launch profile's, so an
  unbound read is a silent default-profile leak. Binding points and seams: `gateway/AGENTS.md`
  § Profile scope (HX002/HX004/HX005/HX012, PS-P05/P06).
- **Machine facts and executable lookup go through `rabbit_platform`** (`rabbit_platform/AGENTS.md`).
- **Dependencies carry upper bounds** (`>=floor,<next_major`; git URLs and Actions pinned to a SHA);
  after editing `pyproject.toml` run `rabbit pm lock` and commit `uv.lock`; never mutate a Rabbit
  environment with raw pip/uv. Full policy: `pm/AGENTS.md`.
- **TypeScript (desktop, TUI, website):** feature-owned nanostores over threaded state, thin route
  roots, narrow hooks and colocated action modules, `interface` for props and shared shapes,
  table-driven dispatch over condition ladders; `src/app` routes, `src/store` atoms, `src/lib` pure
  helpers.
- **Commits and PRs:** rebase onto `main` before merging (a squash from a stale branch silently
  reverts newer fixes); 1–2 invariant tests per fix, proven red on the base.
- **Tests:** always `scripts/run_tests.sh`, never bare `pytest`; behaviour contracts, never
  change-detectors or source-reading tests; host-specific behaviour is tested on that host with
  `@pytest.mark.platforms(...)`, never by faking `sys.platform`; tests never write to `~/.rabbit/`.
  Everything else: `tests/AGENTS.md`.
