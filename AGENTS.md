# Hermes Agent - Development Guide

Instructions for AI coding assistants and developers working on the hermes-agent codebase.

**Never give up on the right solution.**

## What Hermes Is

Hermes is a personal AI agent that runs the same agent core across a CLI, a
messaging gateway (Telegram, Discord, Slack, and ~20 other platforms), a TUI,
and an Electron desktop app. It learns across sessions (memory + skills),
delegates to subagents, runs scheduled jobs, and drives a real terminal and
browser. It is extended primarily through **plugins and skills**, not by
growing the core.

Two properties shape almost every design decision and are the lens for
reviewing any change:

- **Per-conversation prompt caching is sacred.** A long-lived conversation
  reuses a cached prefix every turn. Anything that mutates past context,
  swaps toolsets, or rebuilds the system prompt mid-conversation invalidates
  that cache and multiplies the user's cost. We do not do it (the one
  exception is context compression).
- **The core is a narrow waist; capability lives at the edges.** Every model
  tool we add is sent on every API call, so the bar for a new *core* tool is
  high. Most new capability should arrive as a CLI command + skill, a
  service-gated tool, or a plugin — not as core surface.

## Contribution Rubric — What We Want / What We Don't

This is the project's intent layer. Use it two ways:

1. **For humans and for your own work** — what gets merged and what gets
   rejected, so a contribution aims at the target.
2. **For automated review (the triage sweeper)** — guidance on when a PR is
   safe to close on the three allowed reasons (`implemented_on_main`,
   `cannot_reproduce`, `incoherent`) and, just as important, **when NOT to
   close** one. Taste-based "we don't want this / out of scope" closes are NOT
   an automated decision — those stay with a human maintainer. The sweeper's
   job here is to recognize design intent and *avoid wrongly closing a
   legitimate contribution*, not to make the won't-implement call itself.

Read the balance right: Hermes ships a **lot** — most merges are bug fixes to
real reported behavior, and the product surface (platforms, channels,
providers, models, desktop/TUI features) expands aggressively and on purpose.
The restraint below is aimed squarely at the **core agent + the model tool
schema**, the one place where every addition is paid for on every API call.
"Smallest footprint" governs *how a capability is wired into the core*, NOT
whether the product is allowed to grow. We are expansive at the edges and
conservative at the waist.

### What we want

- **Fix real bugs, well.** The bulk of what lands is `fix(...)` against an
  actual reported symptom. A good fix reproduces the symptom on current
  `main`, points to the exact line where it manifests, and fixes the whole bug
  class — sibling call paths included — not just the one site the reporter hit.
- **Expand reach at the edges.** New platform adapters, channels, providers,
  models, and desktop/TUI/dashboard features are welcome and land routinely,
  including large ones (a new messaging channel, a session-cap feature, a
  Windows PTY bridge). Breadth in the product is a goal, not a footprint
  concern — as long as it integrates with the existing setup/config UX
  (`hermes tools`, `hermes setup`, auto-install) rather than bolting on a raw
  env var.
- **Refactor god-files into clean modules.** Extracting a multi-thousand-line
  cluster out of `cli.py` / `run_agent.py` / `gateway/run.py` into a focused
  mixin or module is wanted work, even when the diff is huge and mechanical
  (large `+N/-N` refactors merge regularly). The "every line traces to the
  request" test applies to *feature* PRs; a declared refactor's request IS the
  extraction.
- **Keep the core narrow.** New *model tools* are the expensive exception —
  every tool ships on every API call. Prefer, in order: extend existing code →
  CLI command + skill → service-gated tool (`check_fn`) → plugin → MCP server
  in the catalog → new core tool (last resort). See "The Footprint Ladder."
- **Extend, don't duplicate.** Before adding a module/manager/hook, check
  whether existing infrastructure already covers the use case. When several PRs
  integrate the same *category*, design one shared interface instead of merging
  them one at a time (see the ABC + orchestrator note under the Footprint
  Ladder).
- **Behavior contracts over snapshots.** Tests should assert how two pieces of
  data must relate (invariants), not freeze a current value (model lists,
  config version literals, enumeration counts). See "Don't write
  change-detector tests."
- **E2E validation, not just green unit mocks.** For anything touching
  resolution chains, config propagation, security boundaries, remote
  backends, or file/network I/O, exercise the real path with real imports
  against a temp `HERMES_HOME`. Mocks hide integration bugs.
- **Cache-, alternation-, and invariant-safe.** Preserve prompt caching, strict
  message role alternation (never two same-role messages in a row; never a
  synthetic user message injected mid-loop), and a system prompt that is
  byte-stable for the life of a conversation.
- **Contributor credit preserved.** Salvage external work by cherry-picking
  (rebase-merge) so authorship survives in git history; don't reimplement from
  scratch when you can build on top.

### What we don't want (rejected even when well-built)

- **Speculative infrastructure.** Hooks, callbacks, or extension points with no
  concrete consumer. Adding a hook is easy; removing one after plugins depend
  on it is hard. A hook is NOT speculative if a contributor has a real, stated
  use case — even if the consumer ships separately.
- **New `HERMES_*` env vars for non-secret config.** `.env` is for secrets
  only (API keys, tokens, passwords). All behavioral settings — timeouts,
  thresholds, feature flags, display prefs — go in `config.yaml`. Bridge to an
  internal env var if the mechanism needs one, but user-facing docs point to
  `config.yaml`. Reject PRs that tell users to "set X in your .env" unless X
  is a credential.
- **A new core tool when terminal + file already do the job, or when a skill
  would.** If the only barrier is file visibility on a remote backend, fix the
  mount, not the toolset.
- **Lazy-reading escape hatches on instructional tools.** No `offset`/`limit`
  pagination on tools that load content the agent must read fully (skills,
  prompts, playbooks). Models will read page 1 and skip the rest.
- **"Fixes" that destroy the feature they secure.** A mitigation that kills the
  feature's purpose is the wrong mitigation. Read the original commit's intent
  (`git log -p -S`) before restricting behavior; find a fix that preserves the
  feature.
- **Outbound telemetry / usage attribution without opt-in gating.** No new
  analytics, third-party identifier tagging, or attribution tags until a
  generic user-facing opt-in (config gate + setup prompt + `hermes tools`
  toggle) exists. Park behind a label, do not merge.
- **Change-detector tests, cache-breaking mid-conversation, dead code wired in
  without E2E proof, and plugins that touch core files.** Plugins live in their
  own directory and work within the ABCs/hooks we provide; if a plugin needs
  more, widen the generic plugin surface, don't special-case it in core.
- **Third-party products / other people's projects integrated into the core
  tree.** Observability backends, vendor SaaS integrations, analytics dashboards,
  and similar "someone else's product" plugins do NOT land under `plugins/` in
  this repo. They place an ongoing maintenance burden on us to keep them working
  against a fast-moving core, for a backend we don't own. Ship them as a
  **standalone plugin repo** users install into `~/.hermes/plugins/` (or via a
  pip entry point), and promote them in the Nous Research Discord
  (`#plugins-skills-and-skins`). This is a coupling-and-maintenance decision, not
  a quality bar — the plugin can be excellent and still be a close. PRs that add
  such a directory to the tree are closed with a pointer to publish it as its own
  repo.

### Before you call it a bug — verify the premise (and when NOT to close)

## Important Policies

### Prompt Caching Must Not Break

Hermes-Agent ensures caching remains valid throughout a conversation. **Do NOT implement changes that would:**
- Alter past context mid-conversation
- Change toolsets mid-conversation
- Reload memories or rebuild system prompts mid-conversation

Cache-breaking forces dramatically higher costs. The ONLY time we alter context is during context compression.

Slash commands that mutate system-prompt state (skills, tools, memory, etc.)
must be **cache-aware**: default to deferred invalidation (change takes
effect next session), with an opt-in `--now` flag for immediate
invalidation. See `/skills install --now` for the canonical pattern.

### Background Process Notifications (Gateway)

When `terminal(background=true, notify_on_complete=true)` is used, the gateway runs a watcher that
detects process completion and triggers a new agent turn. Control verbosity of background process
messages with `display.background_process_notifications`
in config.yaml (or `HERMES_BACKGROUND_NOTIFICATIONS` env var):

- `all` — running-output updates + final message (default)
- `result` — only the final completion message
- `error` — only the final message when exit code != 0
- `off` — no watcher messages at all

## Testing

### Python
**ALWAYS use `scripts/run_tests.sh`** — do not call `pytest` directly. The script enforces
hermetic environment parity with CI (unset credential vars, TZ=UTC, LANG=C.UTF-8,
`-n auto` xdist workers, in-tree subprocess-isolation plugin). Direct `pytest`
on a 16+ core developer machine with API keys set diverges from CI in ways
that have caused multiple "works locally, fails in CI" incidents (and the reverse).

```bash
scripts/run_tests.sh                                  # full suite, CI-parity
scripts/run_tests.sh tests/gateway/                   # one directory
scripts/run_tests.sh tests/agent/test_foo.py::test_x  # one test
scripts/run_tests.sh -v --tb=long                     # pass-through pytest flags
```

**Flake policy:** the runner auto-retries a failing test FILE once in a fresh
subprocess (`--file-retries`, default 1; `HERMES_TEST_FILE_RETRIES=0` to
disable). Pass-on-retry counts as green but is printed in a `⚠ FLAKY` summary
section with both attempts' output. A FLAKY report is a bug to fix, not noise
to ignore — timing-sensitive tests must not assume a quiet runner (loose
wall-clock bounds ≥ 2s, event-based sync, no `assert not _wait_until(...)`
negative-timing races).

#### Subprocess-per-test-file isolation

Every test file runs in a freshly-spawned Python subprocess via `run_tests_parallel.py`. This means module-level dicts/sets and
ContextVars from one test file cannot leak into the next.

#### Why the wrapper

|                     | Without wrapper                             | With wrapper                              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Provider API keys   | Whatever is in your env (auto-detects pool) | All env vars except a specific few unset. |
| HOME / `~/.hermes/` | Your real config+auth.json                  | Temp dir per test                         |
| Timezone            | Local TZ (PDT etc.)                         | UTC                                       |
| Locale              | Whatever is set                             | C.UTF-8                                   |

### Where to place what tests

The CI change classifier (`scripts/ci/classify_changes.py`) runs specific jobs based on what files changed. A Python test that asserts
about the contents of `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `.ts`/`.tsx`
source, or any other JS-side artifact will not run on a PR that only touches
those files. This means a regression can go green on a PR and red on `main` (where the
classifier fails open and runs everything).

Any test that reads or asserts about `package.json`,
`package-lock.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `.ts`/`.tsx`/`.js`/`.mjs`/`.cjs`
source files configuration belongs in the JS (vitest) test suite, not in `tests/*.py`.

### Don't write change-detector tests

A test is a **change-detector** if it fails whenever data that is **expected
to change** gets updated — model catalogs, config version numbers,
enumeration counts, hardcoded lists of provider models. These tests add no
behavioral coverage; they just guarantee that routine source updates break
CI and cost engineering time to "fix."

**Do not write:**

```python
# catalog snapshot — breaks every model release
assert "gemini-2.5-pro" in _PROVIDER_MODELS["gemini"]
assert "MiniMax-M2.7" in models

# config version literal — breaks every schema bump
assert DEFAULT_CONFIG["_config_version"] == 21

# enumeration count — breaks every time a skill/provider is added
assert len(_PROVIDER_MODELS["huggingface"]) == 8
```

**Do write:**

```python
# behavior: does the catalog plumbing work at all?
assert "gemini" in _PROVIDER_MODELS
assert len(_PROVIDER_MODELS["gemini"]) >= 1

# behavior: does migration bump the user's version to current latest?
assert raw["_config_version"] == DEFAULT_CONFIG["_config_version"]

# invariant: no plan-only model leaks into the legacy list
assert not (set(moonshot_models) & coding_plan_only_models)

# invariant: every model in the catalog has a context-length entry
for m in _PROVIDER_MODELS["huggingface"]:
    assert m.lower() in DEFAULT_CONTEXT_LENGTHS_LOWER
```

The rule: if the test reads like a snapshot of current data, delete it. If
it reads like a contract about how two pieces of data must relate, keep it.
When a PR adds a new provider/model and you want a test, make the test
assert the relationship (e.g. "catalog entries all have context lengths"),
not the specific names.

Reviewers should reject new change-detector tests; authors should convert
them into invariants before re-requesting review.

### Never read source code in tests

# Architecture Reference

Detailed architecture (project structure, AIAgent loop, CLI/TUI/desktop, plugins, skills, toolsets, curator, cron, kanban, profiles, skins) is in the `hermes-agent-architecture` skill. Load it on demand — keeping it out of AGENTS.md prevents per-turn truncation at 20K chars and the resulting 100+ compressions per session.
