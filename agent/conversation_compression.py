"""Context compression — extract the AIAgent methods that drive summarisation.

Three concerns live here:

* :func:`check_compression_model_feasibility` — startup probe of the
  configured auxiliary compression model.  Warns when the aux context
  window can't fit the main model's compression threshold; auto-lowers
  the session threshold when possible; hard-rejects auxes below
  ``MINIMUM_CONTEXT_LENGTH``.

* :func:`replay_compression_warning` — re-emit a stored warning through
  the gateway ``status_callback`` once it's wired up (the callback is
  set after :class:`AIAgent` construction).

* :func:`compress_context` — the actual compression call.  Runs the
  configured compressor, splits the SQLite session, rotates the
  session_id, notifies plugin context engines / memory providers, and
  returns the compressed message list and freshly-built system prompt.

* :func:`try_shrink_image_parts_in_messages` — image-too-large recovery
  helper that re-encodes ``data:image/...;base64,...`` parts at a smaller
  size so retries can fit under provider ceilings (Anthropic's 5 MB).

``run_agent`` keeps thin wrappers for each so existing call sites
(``self._compress_context(...)``) keep working.  Tests that exercise
these paths see no behavioural change.
