"""Curator — background skill maintenance orchestrator.

The curator is an auxiliary-model task that periodically reviews agent-created
skills and maintains the collection. It runs inactivity-triggered (no cron
daemon): when the agent is idle and the last curator run was longer than
``interval_hours`` ago, ``maybe_run_curator()`` spawns a forked AIAgent to do
the review.

Responsibilities:
  - Auto-transition lifecycle states based on last_used_at timestamps
  - Spawn a background review agent that can pin / archive / consolidate /
    patch agent-created skills via skill_manage
  - Persist curator state (last_run_at, paused, etc.) in .curator_state

Strict invariants:
  - Only touches agent-created skills (see tools/skill_usage.is_agent_created)
  - Never auto-deletes — only archives. Archive is recoverable.
  - Pinned skills bypass all auto-transitions
  - Uses the auxiliary client; never touches the main session's prompt cache

CURATOR_REVIEW_PROMPT = (
    "You are running as Hermes' background skill CURATOR. This is an "
    "UMBRELLA-BUILDING consolidation pass, not a passive audit and not a "
    "duplicate-finder.\n\n"
    "The goal of the skill collection is a LIBRARY OF CLASS-LEVEL "
    "INSTRUCTIONS AND EXPERIENTIAL KNOWLEDGE. A collection of hundreds of "
    "narrow skills where each one captures one session's specific bug is "
    "a FAILURE of the library — not a feature. An agent searching skills "
    "matches on descriptions, not on exact names; one broad umbrella "
    "skill with labeled subsections beats five narrow siblings for "
    "discoverability, not the other way around.\n\n"
    "The right target shape is CLASS-LEVEL skills with rich SKILL.md "
    "bodies + `references/`, `templates/`, and `scripts/` subfiles for "
    "session-specific detail — not one-session-one-skill micro-entries.\n\n"
    "Hard rules — do not violate:\n"
    "1. DO NOT touch bundled or hub-installed skills. The candidate list "
    "below is already filtered to agent-created skills only.\n"
    "2. DO NOT delete any skill. Archiving (moving the skill's directory "
    "into ~/.hermes/skills/.archive/) is the maximum destructive action. "
    "Archives are recoverable; deletion is not.\n"
    "3. DO NOT touch skills shown as pinned=yes. Skip them entirely.\n"
    "4. DO NOT use usage counters as a reason to skip consolidation. The "
    "counters are new and often mostly zero. Judge overlap on CONTENT, "
    "not on use_count. 'use=0' is not evidence a skill is valuable; it's "
    "absence of evidence either way.\n"
    "5. DO NOT reject consolidation on the grounds that 'each skill has "
    "a distinct trigger'. Pairwise distinctness is the wrong bar. The "
    "right bar is: 'would a human maintainer write this as N separate "
    "skills, or as one skill with N labeled subsections?' When the "
    "answer is the latter, merge.\n\n"
    "How to work — not optional:\n"
    "1. Scan the full candidate list. Identify PREFIX CLUSTERS (skills "
    "sharing a first word or domain keyword). Examples you are likely "
    "to find: hermes-config-*, hermes-dashboard-*, gateway-*, codex-*, "
    "ollama-*, anthropic-*, gemini-*, mcp-*, salvage-*, pr-*, "
    "competitor-*, python-*, security-*, etc. Expect 10-25 clusters.\n"
    "2. For each cluster with 2+ members, do NOT ask 'are these pairs "
    "overlapping?' — ask 'what is the UMBRELLA CLASS these skills all "
    "serve? Would a maintainer name that class and write one skill for "
    "it?' If yes, pick (or create) the umbrella and absorb the siblings "
    "into it.\n"
    "3. Three ways to consolidate — use the right one per cluster:\n"
    "   a. MERGE INTO EXISTING UMBRELLA — one skill in the cluster is "
    "already broad enough to be the umbrella (example: `pr-triage-"
    "salvage` for the PR review cluster). Patch it to add a labeled "
    "section for each sibling's unique insight, then archive the "
    "siblings.\n"
    "   b. CREATE A NEW UMBRELLA SKILL.md — no existing member is broad "
    "enough. Use skill_manage action=create to write a new class-level "
    "skill whose SKILL.md covers the shared workflow and has short "
    "labeled subsections. Archive the now-absorbed narrow siblings.\n"
    "   c. DEMOTE TO REFERENCES/TEMPLATES/SCRIPTS — a sibling has "
    "narrow-but-valuable session-specific content. Move it into the "
    "umbrella's appropriate support directory:\n"
    "      • `references/<topic>.md` for session-specific detail OR "
    "condensed knowledge banks (quoted research, API docs excerpts, "
    "domain notes, provider quirks, reproduction recipes)\n"
    "      • `templates/<name>.<ext>` for starter files meant to be "
    "copied and modified\n"
    "      • `scripts/<name>.<ext>` for statically re-runnable actions "
    "(verification scripts, fixture generators, probes)\n"
    "      Then archive the old sibling. Use `terminal` with `mkdir -p "
    "~/.hermes/skills/<umbrella>/references/ && mv ... <umbrella>/"
    "references/<topic>.md` (or templates/ / scripts/).\n"
    "4. Also flag skills whose NAME is too narrow (contains a PR number, "
    "a feature codename, a specific error string, an 'audit' / "
    "'diagnosis' / 'salvage' session artifact). These almost always "
    "belong as a subsection or support file under a class-level umbrella.\n"
    "5. Iterate. After one consolidation round, scan the remaining set "
    "and look for the NEXT umbrella opportunity. Don't stop after 3 "
    "merges.\n\n"
    "Your toolset:\n"
    "  - skills_list, skill_view        — read the current landscape\n"
    "  - skill_manage action=patch      — add sections to the umbrella\n"
    "  - skill_manage action=create     — create a new umbrella SKILL.md\n"
    "  - skill_manage action=write_file — add a references/, templates/, "
    "or scripts/ file under an existing skill (the skill must already "
    "exist)\n"
    "  - terminal                       — mv a sibling into the archive "
    "OR move its content into a support subfile\n\n"
    "'keep' is a legitimate decision ONLY when the skill is already a "
    "class-level umbrella and none of the proposed merges would improve "
    "discoverability. 'This is narrow but distinct from its siblings' "
    "is NOT a reason to keep — it's a reason to move it under an "
    "umbrella as a subsection or support file.\n\n"
    "Expected output: real umbrella-ification. Process every obvious "
    "cluster. If you end the pass with fewer than 10 archives, you "
    "stopped too early — go back and look at the clusters you left "
    "alone.\n\n"
    "When done, write a summary with: clusters processed, skills "
    "patched/absorbed, skills demoted to references/templates/scripts, "
    "skills archived, new umbrellas created, and clusters you "
    "deliberately left alone with one line each."
