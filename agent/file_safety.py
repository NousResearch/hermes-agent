        carrier.
      * Credential / secret stores under HERMES_HOME and the global Hermes

        and HMAC secrets that the agent never needs to read directly —
        provider tools / gateway adapters consume them through internal
        channels.

    **This is NOT a security boundary.** The terminal tool runs as the
    same OS user with shell access; the agent can still ``cat auth.json``
    or ``cat ~/.hermes/.env`` and exfiltrate the file. The read-deny exists

      * Returns a clear error to models that respect tool denials, which

        for the shell.
      * Surfaces a visible audit trail when something tries to read
        credentials — easier to spot in logs than a generic ``cat``.

    Treat any user-visible framing around this as "may help" rather than
    "stops attackers." A determined model or malicious instruction can
    always shell out.

    Callers that resolve relative paths against a non-process cwd
    (e.g. ``TERMINAL_CWD`` in ``tools/file_tools.py``) MUST pre-resolve
    and pass the absolute path string.  This function's own ``resolve()``
    is anchored at the Python process cwd, so a relative input like

# plugins / cron jobs / memories affect a different session the user runs
# from a different shell.
#
# Soft guard, NOT a security boundary: the agent runs as the same OS user
# and has unrestricted terminal access, so this returns a warning the model
# can choose to honor or override with ``cross_profile=True``. Same shape
# as the dangerous-command approval flow — the agent is told the boundary
# exists, and explicit user direction is required to cross it.
#
# Reference: May 2026 incident where a hermes-security profile session
# edited skills under both ``~/.hermes/profiles/hermes-security/skills/``
# AND ``~/.hermes/skills/`` (the default profile's skills) without realizing
# the second path belonged to a different profile.
