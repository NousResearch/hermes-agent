"""Service-level orchestration for LSP clients.

The :class:`LSPService` is the bridge between the synchronous
file_operations layer and the async :class:`agent.lsp.client.LSPClient`.

Design choices:

- A **single asyncio event loop** runs in a background thread.  All
  client work happens on that loop.  Synchronous callers from
  ``tools/file_operations.py`` use :meth:`get_diagnostics_sync` to
  open + wait + drain in one blocking call.

- One client per ``(server_id, workspace_root)`` key.  Lazy spawn:
  the first request for a key spawns the client; subsequent requests
  re-use it.

- A **broken-set** records ``(server_id, workspace_root)`` pairs that
  failed to spawn or initialize.  These are never retried for the
  life of the service.  Mirrors OpenCode's design.

- A **delta baseline** map keeps "diagnostics-as-of-the-last-snapshot"
  per file.  ``snapshot_baseline()`` is called BEFORE a write; the
  next ``get_diagnostics_sync()`` returns only diagnostics that
  weren't in the baseline.  This is the lift from Claude Code's
  ``beforeFileEdited`` / ``getNewDiagnostics`` pattern, except wired
  to the local LSP layer instead of MCP IDE RPC.

The service is **off by default** — call :meth:`is_active` to check
whether it's actually doing anything.  When LSP is disabled in
config, when no git workspace can be detected, when all configured
servers are missing binaries and auto-install is off, ``is_active``
returns False and the file_operations layer falls through to the
in-process syntax check.
