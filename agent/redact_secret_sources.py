"""Exact-value redaction of values applied from external secret sources (Bitwarden, 1Password,
command sources, ...).

The shape-based passes in ``agent.redact`` cannot recognise an arbitrary vault value (a
``DATABASE_URL``, an opaque field with no vendor prefix), so ``hermes_cli.env_loader`` publishes
each home's applied values here whenever it publishes that home's snapshot, and every
``redact_sensitive_text`` caller plus the tool-result builder scrub them by exact substring.

Keyed by ``hermes_home_key`` so a multiplex gateway never scrubs profile B's output with profile
A's values (which would also confirm to B that the bytes exist). A publish REPLACES the home's set:
the size tracks the configured sources instead of growing with every re-pull, and nothing is
evicted while it is still applied. Memory only: never persisted or logged.

# masks, or it is multi-line (keys, certificates, service-account JSON). Values under 8 characters
# never register: a short secret-named value echoed bare is left to the ``KEY=VALUE`` pattern pass.
