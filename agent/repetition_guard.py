"""Cheap content-sanity checks for completed model output.

A model in a degenerate repetition loop can spend its ENTIRE output budget echoing one fragment;
the ``finish_reason=length`` continuation would then stitch it into the final response with a
"continue" nudge (one incident: a 60k-char turn delivered as 31 Discord messages). This detects
repetition-dominated fragments BEFORE the nudge so the turn aborts with a clear error. Deliberately
conservative: only LONG verbatim repeats (60+ chars) covering a majority of the fragment trip it.
