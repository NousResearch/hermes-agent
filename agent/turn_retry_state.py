"""Per-attempt recovery bookkeeping for the conversation turn loop.

The inner retry loop in ``run_conversation`` (``while retry_count <
max_retries``) makes several distinct recovery attempts on a single model API
call: a credential-pool 429 retry, a per-provider OAuth refresh (codex,
anthropic, nous, copilot), a long-context compression restart, a length-
continuation restart, and a handful of format-recovery branches (thinking-
signature stripping, multimodal-tool-content stripping, llama.cpp grammar
fallback, image shrink, invalid-encrypted-content, 1M-beta header).

Each of those branches is guarded by a one-shot boolean so it fires at most
once per attempt. They used to be ~16 bare ``*_attempted`` / ``has_retried_*``
/ ``restart_with_*`` locals declared inline before the loop and threaded
through its 2,400-line body. ``TurnRetryState`` collapses them into one object
the loop mutates in place (``state.codex_auth_retry_attempted = True``), giving
the recovery bookkeeping a single named, testable home.

Loop-control variables (``retry_count``, ``max_retries``,
``max_compression_attempts``) intentionally stay as plain locals — they are the
``while`` mechanics, not recovery bookkeeping, and putting them on the object
would add indirection without clarifying anything.

This module is dependency-free so it can be unit-tested in isolation and
imported by the turn loop without an import cycle.
