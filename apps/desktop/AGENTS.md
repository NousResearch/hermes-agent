### Electron Desktop Chat App (`apps/desktop/`)

A **separate** chat surface from both the classic CLI and the dashboard's embedded TUI. It is an Electron + React + nanostore renderer (`@assistant-ui/react`) that talks to a `tui_gateway` backend over JSON-RPC (`requestGateway(method, params)`). It does NOT embed `hermes --tui` — it has its own composer, transcript, and slash-command pipeline. Route desktop bugs to the `hermes-desktop-app-work` skill, not `hermes-dashboard-work`.

**Slash commands in the desktop app are curated client-side, then dispatched to the backend.** The pipeline:

- **Backend already provides everything.** `tui_gateway/server.py` `commands.catalog` (empty-query list) and `complete.slash` (typed-query completions) both include built-in commands, user `quick_commands`, AND skill-derived commands (`scan_skill_commands()` / `get_skill_commands()`). The desktop app does not need a new RPC to see skills.
- **The renderer curates via `apps/desktop/src/lib/desktop-slash-commands.ts`.** This is the load-bearing file. It holds `DESKTOP_COMMANDS` (the ~19 built-ins shown in the palette) plus block-lists for terminal-only / messaging-only / picker-owned / settings-owned / advanced commands that should NOT clutter the desktop popover.
  - `isDesktopSlashCommand(name)` — gates **execution**. Returns true for built-ins AND for any non-built-in (skill / quick command), so typed extension commands run.
  - `isDesktopSlashSuggestion(name)` — gates **discovery/completion**. Used by BOTH completion paths in `app/chat/composer/hooks/use-slash-completions.ts` (empty-query catalog filter + typed-query `complete.slash` filter) and by `filterDesktopCommandsCatalog`.
  - `isDesktopSlashExtensionCommand(name)` — true when the command is NOT a known Hermes built-in (i.e. a skill or user quick command). Both suggestion and catalog-filter paths allow extensions through so skill commands surface in the palette. (Added when fixing "skill commands missing from the desktop slash palette" — the curated allow-list was silently dropping every skill/quick command from completions even though they executed fine when typed.)
- **Dispatch** lives in `app/session/hooks/use-prompt-actions.ts` (`runSlash`): built-ins that the desktop owns (`/skin`, `/help`, `/new`, …) are handled locally or via `commands.catalog`; everything else goes to `slash.exec`, falling back to `command.dispatch` (which the gateway resolves into skill / alias / exec directives). A skill command resolves to `{type: "skill", message}` and is submitted as a normal prompt.

**Rule:** the desktop slash palette's curation is about hiding noise (terminal-only / messaging-only built-ins), NOT about hiding user-activated extensions. Skill commands and `quick_commands` are extensions the backend surfaces — they belong in completions. If you tighten `desktop-slash-commands.ts`, keep `isDesktopSlashExtensionCommand` flowing into both the suggestion and catalog-filter paths. Tests: `apps/desktop/src/lib/desktop-slash-commands.test.ts` (run via the repo-root `vitest`, since `apps/desktop` resolves deps from the root workspace install).
