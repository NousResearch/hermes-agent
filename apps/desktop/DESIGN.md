# Desktop Design System

Conventions for the Electron desktop app (`apps/desktop`). Read this before
adding a component, overlay, or style. The rule of thumb: **one source per
concern, tokens over literals, flat over boxed.** If you reach for a raw color,
a one-off shadow, a bespoke button, or a hardcoded `px-*` on a control — stop,
there's already a primitive for it.

## Principles

1. **Flat, not boxed.** No card-in-card, no divider borders inside a panel.
   Group with whitespace and a single hairline, never nested rounded boxes.
2. **Borderless + shadow for elevation.** Overlays float on `shadow-nous` + a
   `--stroke-nous` hairline, not hard borders.
3. **One primitive per concern.** One `Button`, one set of control variants,
   one `SearchField`, one `Loader`, one `ErrorState`. Migrate onto them; don't
   fork.
4. **Tokens, not literals.** Reference CSS vars (`--ui-*`, `--shadow-nous`,
   `--theme-*`), never raw hex / ad-hoc rgba in components.
5. **Style lives in the primitive.** Variants and sizes own padding, radius,
   color, chrome. Call sites pass a `variant`/`size`, not `className` overrides
   that re-specify those.

## Surfaces & elevation

Every overlay / dialog / toast (boot-failure, install, notifications,
model-picker, onboarding, prompt-overlays, updates, base `Dialog`) uses:

```
shadow-nous           /* downward-weighted, layered contact→ambient falloff */
border-(--stroke-nous) /* currentColor hairline, theme-adaptive */
```

Both are CSS vars in `src/styles.css` — tune in one place, everything inherits.
Don't add per-overlay `shadow-[…]` or `border-(--ui-stroke-secondary)`
one-offs; if elevation needs to change, change the token.

## Stroke & color tokens

| Token | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `--ui-stroke-primary…quaternary` | hairlines, in descending strength |
| `--ui-stroke-tertiary` | the default in-panel divider / list hairline |
| `--stroke-nous` | the overlay hairline (pairs with `shadow-nous`) |
| `--ui-text-primary / -secondary / -tertiary` | text hierarchy |
| `--ui-bg-quaternary` | soft control fill (secondary button) |
| `--chrome-action-hover` | hover fill for quiet controls |
| `--theme-primary`, `--ui-accent` | brand/accent |

Never hardcode `border-gray-*`, `bg-white`, `text-black`, etc. The white tile in
`BrandMark` is the one sanctioned literal (the mark needs a fixed backdrop).

## Buttons — one component

`src/components/ui/button.tsx` is the single source. Pick a `variant` + `size`;
do **not** pass `h-*`, `px-*`, `py-*`, or icon-size overrides.

**Variants:** `default` (primary), `destructive`, `secondary` (soft fill —
the default non-primary look), `outline` (transparent + 1px inset ring, no
fill/shadow), `ghost`, `link`, `text` (boxless quiet inline — "Cancel",
"Clear"), `textStrong` (bold underlined inline affordance — "Change",
"Open logs").

**Sizes:** `default`, `xs`, `sm`, `lg`, `inline` (flush, zero box — for buttons
that sit inside a heading/sentence; replaces `h-auto px-0 py-0`), and the icon
family `icon` / `icon-xs` / `icon-sm` / `icon-lg` / `icon-titlebar`.

Notes:
- Text buttons are square (no radius) and sized by padding + line-height (no
  fixed heights). Only icon buttons carry the shared 4px radius.
- SVGs inherit `size-3.5` (`size-3` at `xs`). Don't re-set icon size.
- Polymorph with `asChild` when the button must render as a link/Slot.

## Form controls

- **`controlVariants`** (`src/components/ui/control.ts`) is the shared shape for
  `Input` / `Textarea` / `SelectTrigger`. New text-entry controls compose it.
- **`SearchField`** — borderless, underline-on-focus, auto-width. The only
  search input. Don't build boxed search bars; don't wrap it in a bordered tile.
  Empty lists hide their search field.
- **`SegmentedControl`** — the choice control for small mutually-exclusive sets
  (color mode, tool-call display, usage period). Replaces radio piles and
  pill rows.
- **`Switch`** (`size="xs"`) — bare, with `aria-label`. No bordered text wrapper.

## Layout

- **Gutters:** `PAGE_INSET_X` (`src/app/layout-constants.ts`) for page side
  padding; `PAGE_INSET_NEG_X` to bleed a child to the edge. Don't hardcode
  `px-6`/`px-8` on pages.
- **Master/detail overlays:** `OverlaySplitLayout` + `OverlaySidebar` /
  `OverlayMain`. Cron, profiles, etc. ride this — don't rebuild a titlebar
  shell.
- **Rows:** `ListRow` (settings `primitives.tsx`) for label/description/action
  rows. Flat, flush-left; no per-row indentation that fights flush headers.
- **No dividers between rows** unless the list genuinely needs them; prefer
  spacing. When you do need one, it's a single `--ui-stroke-tertiary` hairline.

## Sidebar notifications

- Profile rail badges must be derived from the same visible notification state
  as session rows. Do not count stale ids, persisted hints, or background
  sessions unless a loaded row would show the matching marker.
- Opening a session must acknowledge all aliases for that row (`id`, pin id,
  lineage root), so rail badges and row markers reset together.

## Feedback & empty/error/loading states

- **Loading:** `Loader` (`src/components/ui/loader.tsx`) — animated math/ascii
  curves (`lemniscate-bloom` for long ops). Never ship the literal text
  "Loading…".
- **Errors:** `ErrorState` + the canonical `ErrorIcon` (no bg chip). One look
  for the React boundary, in-dialog errors, and the boot-failure banner. Pass
  nodes for title/description so Radix `DialogTitle`/`Description` can flow
  through for a11y.
- **Logs:** `LogView` — no bg, hairline border, tight padding, small mono.
  Every place we surface raw logs uses it.
- **Empty:** `EmptyState` / `EmptyPanel` — don't hand-roll centered empties.

## Iconography & brand

- **`Codicon`** is the icon set. No mixing icon libraries inline.
- **`BrandMark`** (`src/components/brand-mark.tsx`) is the brand glyph — the
  `nous-girl` mark on a white tile, softly rounded, identical in light/dark.
  It replaced scattered Sparkles glyphs in updates / onboarding / about. Use it
  for hero/brand moments; don't reintroduce decorative star/sparkle icons.

## Motion

- Quick, functional transitions (~100ms on controls). Respect
  `prefers-reduced-motion` for anything beyond a fade.
- Choreographed exits (e.g. onboarding's "matrix" fade-down) stagger per-element
  then settle the surface — the outer container's fade is *delayed* so it
  doesn't swallow the inner animation. Don't let a global fade race the detail.

## i18n

- Every user-facing string goes through `useI18n()` (`src/i18n/context.tsx`).
  No literals in JSX.
- **Update all locales together** — `en`, `ja`, `zh`, `zh-hant`. A string change
  in `en.ts` that skips the others is a regression (drifted punctuation,
  stale labels). Keep trailing-punctuation and tone consistent across all four.

## State (TypeScript)

Mirrors the repo TS style (see root `AGENTS.md`):

- Shared/cross-component state → small **nanostores**, not prop-drilling.
  Each feature owns its atoms; shared atoms live in `src/store`.
- Rendering components subscribe with `useStore`; non-render actions read with
  `$atom.get()`.
- Colocated action modules over god hooks. A hook owns one narrow job.
- Keep persistence beside the atom that owns it. Route roots stay thin.
- Prefer `interface` for public props; extend React primitives
  (`React.ComponentProps<'button'>`, `Omit<…>`).

## Affordances

- `cursor-pointer` at the primitive level (Button, dropdown/select) — don't
  hardcode it per call site.
- Global focus-ring reset; titlebar actions have no active-background state.
- `Esc` closes every dismissable overlay/dialog (install/onboarding excluded);
  close is an x-icon, not the word "Close".

## Before you add something — checklist

- [ ] Reuse a primitive (`Button`, `SearchField`, `SegmentedControl`,
      `ListRow`, `Loader`, `ErrorState`, `LogView`) instead of forking one?
- [ ] Tokens (`--ui-*`, `shadow-nous`, `--stroke-nous`) — zero raw colors /
      one-off shadows?
- [ ] No `className` overriding a primitive's padding / size / radius / chrome?
- [ ] Overlay uses `shadow-nous` + `border-(--stroke-nous)`, no hard border?
- [ ] Flat — no card-in-card, no gratuitous row dividers?
- [ ] All four locales updated for any new/changed string?
- [ ] `cursor-pointer`, focus ring, and `Esc`-to-close behave?
