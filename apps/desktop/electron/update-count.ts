// Whether `git rev-list HEAD..origin/<branch> --count` produces a meaningful
// number worth computing. On a SHALLOW checkout (installer clones with
// --depth 1) the local history often shares no merge-base with the freshly
// fetched origin tip, so the count enumerates the entire remote ancestry and
// returns a bogus huge number (e.g. 12104) — see #51922. resolveBehindCount
// discards that bogus count in favour of a SHA compare, so the caller should
// SKIP the expensive rev-list entirely in that case rather than run it and
// throw the result away.

// fall back to a binary up-to-date check by SHA, exactly like the official-SSH

// (developers / Docker dev images) keep the exact count path unchanged.
