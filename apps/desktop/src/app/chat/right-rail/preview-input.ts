/**
 * PREVIEW INPUT REGISTRY — real input into the preview pane's guest page, the
 * difference between the agent DRIVING the browser and merely poking its DOM.
 *
 * `executeJavaScript` can only ever dispatch synthetic events: `isTrusted` is
 * false, the browser's own hover target never moves, `:hover` rules never
 * match, and hover-gated menus never open — so a click lands on a dropdown item
 * that was never rendered. `sendInputEvent` goes in through Chromium's input
 * pipeline instead, producing the same events a hand on the mouse would.
 *
 * It has to be called on the `<webview>` ELEMENT. Sending to the embedder's
 * webContents does not reach a guest (electron/electron#20333), which is why
 * this is a per-pane registry rather than something main could do.
 *
 * Coordinates are relative to the webview, and the webview IS the guest
 * viewport — so a rect the act engine measured inside the page needs no
 * conversion on the way back out.
