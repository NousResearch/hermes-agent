/** The focused session's context breakdown, fetched as soon as the statusbar
 *  gauge is on screen rather than when its popover opens.
 *
 *  The backend only reports measured context occupancy (`last_prompt_tokens`)
 *  once a turn has run in THIS process, so a resumed session reports none —
 *  which is why turning the gauge on used to do nothing at all until you sent
 *  a message. `session.context_breakdown` estimates the same figure from the
 *  live system prompt + tools + transcript, so it answers for a session that
 *  hasn't spoken yet. It is a read-only chars/4 pass: no provider call, no
 *  prompt-cache impact.
 *
 *  Refetches when the focused session changes and when a turn ends (the
 *  transcript just grew). Held keyed by the session it describes so switching
 *  sessions drops the previous numbers instead of painting them under the new
 *  session's name. */
