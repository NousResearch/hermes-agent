/**
 * Live skin sync from the Hermes backend.
 *
 * The backend resolves the active skin (built-in or `$HERMES_HOME/skins/*.yaml`)
 * and announces it on `gateway.ready` / `skin.changed`, and answers `config.get
 * skin` with the same payload. `ingestBackendSkin` folds that into the desktop:
 *
 *   1. Registers the converted theme in `$backendThemes` so it appears wherever a
 *      built-in does — Appearance, Cmd-K, `/skin` — with no per-surface wiring
 *      (`listAllThemes` merges this store).
 *   2. When asked to apply (an explicit change), requests the switch via
 *      `$pendingSkinApply`, which the ThemeProvider drains through `setTheme`.
 *
 * `gateway.ready` seeds the baseline WITHOUT applying, so a fresh connect never
 * stomps the user's persisted desktop theme; only a genuine name change (Hermes
 * authoring/activating a skin from a prompt, or `/skin` elsewhere) repaints.
