    not on every session). Branching a worktree from that stale ``HEAD`` roots
    every new branch on an old base — so the PR diff GitHub computes against
    current ``main`` balloons with unrelated changes, and the agent has to
    discover the staleness via the pre-push gate and rebase. Branching from the
    freshly-fetched remote tip instead means the worktree starts current.

    Strategy (each step falls back to the next on failure):
      1. If the current branch tracks an upstream, fetch and use that upstream
         ref — so a deliberate feature-branch worktree tracks its own remote,
         not the default branch.

    removal never orphans the branch (which would drop easy reachability of any
    commits still in the worktree).

    Also prunes orphaned ``hermes/*`` and ``pr-*`` local branches that
