"""Write a queued cron delivery's terminal outcome back onto the run that queued it.

An agent run hands its send to ``cron.delivery_queue`` and books ``last_status =
"delivery_queued"`` / ledger ``delivery_outcome = "queued"``. Once a gateway drain sends,
refuses, suppresses or fences the send ``unknown``, the job record and the execution
ledger must carry the real result (main's inline ``ok``/``delivered`` and
``delivery_failed``/``failed`` + ``last_delivery_error``); otherwise ``hermes cron list``
says "delivery still in progress" forever and refused sends never surface.

Both sides call :func:`settle_queued_delivery`: the drain right after it terminalizes a
row, and the run right after its own bookkeeping (a drain can finish before the run's
``mark_job_run`` lands). Every write is fenced on the execution id, so the call is
idempotent and never rewrites a later run's status.
