"""Gateway lifecycle guard for cron job creation (#30719).

An agent running inside a gateway can schedule a cron job that calls
``hermes gateway restart`` (or ``launchctl kickstart ai.hermes.gateway``
or ``systemctl restart hermes-gateway``).  When the cron fires, the
gateway dies, the supervisor (launchd KeepAlive / systemd Restart=)
revives it, auto-resume picks up the offending session, and the resumed
turn re-runs the same logic — a SIGTERM-respawn loop every ~10 seconds
until manually broken.

This module rejects cron job specs whose prompt or script contains a
direct shell-level gateway-lifecycle command.  It is enforced at
``cron.jobs.create_job`` so it fires on every job-creation path: the
``hermes cron create`` CLI subcommand AND the agent's ``cronjob`` model
tool (which calls ``create_job`` directly, bypassing the CLI layer).

The pattern is intentionally command-shaped: it anchors on a concrete
command identifier (``hermes gateway``, ``launchctl ... hermes-gateway``,
``systemctl ... hermes-gateway``, ``pkill`` against the gateway) so it
cannot fire on prose.  A cron ``prompt`` is fed to a future LLM, not a
shell, so an over-broad substring match on English ("Kong API gateway
autoscaling and restart behavior") would produce a high false-positive
rate without preventing the actual foot-gun, which requires a real
command shape.

This is a defence-in-depth layer.  ``tools/terminal_tool.py`` already
blocks these commands at *execution* time when ``_HERMES_GATEWAY=1``, and
``hermes gateway stop|restart`` refuse to self-target from inside the
gateway.  Blocking at *creation* time as well means the agent gets an
immediate, informative rejection instead of scheduling a job that will
only fail (silently) when it fires.
