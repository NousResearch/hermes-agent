## Curator (skill lifecycle)

Background skill-maintenance system that tracks usage on agent-created
skills and auto-archives stale ones. Users never lose skills; archives
go to `~/.hermes/skills/.archive/` and are restorable.

- **Core:** `agent/curator.py` (review loop, auto-transitions, LLM review
  prompt) + `agent/curator_backup.py` (pre-run tar.gz snapshots).
- **CLI:** `hermes_cli/curator.py` wires `hermes curator <verb>` where
  verbs are: `status`, `run`, `pause`, `resume`, `pin`, `unpin`,
  `archive`, `restore`, `prune`, `backup`, `rollback`.
- **Telemetry:** `tools/skill_usage.py` owns the sidecar
  `~/.hermes/skills/.usage.json` — per-skill `use_count`, `view_count`,
  `patch_count`, `last_activity_at`, `state` (active / stale /
  archived), `pinned`.

Invariants:
- Curator only touches skills with `created_by: "agent"` provenance —
  bundled + hub-installed skills are off-limits.
- Never deletes; max destructive action is archive.
- Pinned skills are exempt from every auto-transition and from the
  LLM review pass.
- `skill_manage(action="delete")` refuses pinned skills; patch/edit/
  write_file/remove_file go through so the agent can keep improving
  pinned skills.

Config section (`curator:` in `config.yaml`):
`enabled`, `interval_hours`, `min_idle_hours`, `stale_after_days`,
`archive_after_days`, `backup.*`.
