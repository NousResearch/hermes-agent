## Kanban (multi-agent work queue)

Durable SQLite-backed board that lets multiple profiles / workers
collaborate on shared tasks. Users drive it via `hermes kanban <verb>`;
workers spawned by the dispatcher drive it via a dedicated `kanban_*`
toolset so their schema footprint is zero when they're not inside a
kanban task.

- **CLI:** `hermes_cli/kanban.py` wires `hermes kanban` with verbs
  `init`, `create`, `list` (alias `ls`), `show`, `assign`, `link`,
  `unlink`, `comment`, `complete`, `block`, `unblock`, `archive`,
  `tail`, plus less-commonly-used `watch`, `stats`, `runs`, `log`,
  `assignees`, `heartbeat`, `notify-*`, `dispatch`, `daemon`, `gc`.
- **Worker/orchestrator toolset:** `tools/kanban_tools.py` exposes
  `kanban_show`, `kanban_complete`, `kanban_block`, `kanban_heartbeat`,
  `kanban_comment`, `kanban_create`, `kanban_link`; profiles that
  explicitly enable the `kanban` toolset outside a dispatcher-spawned
  task also get `kanban_list` and `kanban_unblock` for board routing.
- **Dispatcher:** long-lived loop that (default every 60s) reclaims
  stale claims, promotes ready tasks, atomically claims, and spawns
  assigned profiles. Runs **inside the gateway** by default via
  `kanban.dispatch_in_gateway: true`.
- **Plugin assets:** `plugins/kanban/dashboard/` (web UI) +
  `plugins/kanban/systemd/` (`hermes-kanban-dispatcher.service` for
  standalone dispatcher deployment).

Isolation model:
- **Board** is the hard boundary — workers are spawned with
  `HERMES_KANBAN_BOARD` pinned in their env so they can't see other
  boards.
- **Tenant** is a soft namespace *within* a board — one specialist
  fleet can serve multiple businesses with workspace-path + memory-key
  isolation.
- After `kanban.failure_limit` consecutive non-success attempts on the
  same task (default: 2), the dispatcher auto-blocks it to prevent spin
  loops.
