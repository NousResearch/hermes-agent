# Testing

## Testing

**ALWAYS use `scripts/run_tests.sh`** — do not call `pytest` directly. The script enforces
hermetic environment parity with CI (unset credential vars, TZ=UTC, LANG=C.UTF-8,
4 xdist workers matching GHA ubuntu-latest). Direct `pytest` on a 16+ core
developer machine with API keys set diverges from CI in ways that have caused
multiple "works locally, fails in CI" incidents (and the reverse).

```bash
scripts/run_tests.sh                                  # full suite, CI-parity
scripts/run_tests.sh tests/gateway/                   # one directory
scripts/run_tests.sh tests/agent/test_foo.py::test_x  # one test
scripts/run_tests.sh -v --tb=long                     # pass-through pytest flags
```

### Why the wrapper (and why the old "just call pytest" doesn't work)

Five real sources of local-vs-CI drift the script closes:

| | Without wrapper | With wrapper |
|---|---|---|
| Provider API keys | Whatever is in your env (auto-detects pool) | All `*_API_KEY`/`*_TOKEN`/etc. unset |
| HOME / `~/.hermes/` | Your real config+auth.json | Temp dir per test |
| Timezone | Local TZ (PDT etc.) | UTC |
| Locale | Whatever is set | C.UTF-8 |
| xdist workers | `-n auto` = all cores (20+ on a workstation) | `-n 4` matching CI |

`tests/conftest.py` also enforces points 1-4 as an autouse fixture so ANY pytest
invocation (including IDE integrations) gets hermetic behavior — but the wrapper
is belt-and-suspenders.

### Running without the wrapper (only if you must)

If you can't use the wrapper (e.g. on Windows or inside an IDE that shells
pytest directly), at minimum activate the venv and pass `-n 4`:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate   # or: source venv/bin/activate
python -m pytest tests/ -q -n 4
```

Worker count above 4 will surface test-ordering flakes that CI never sees.

Always run the full suite before pushing changes.

### Don't write change-detector tests

A test is a **change-detector** if it fails whenever data that is **expected
to change** gets updated — model catalogs, config version numbers,
enumeration counts, hardcoded lists of provider models. These tests add no
behavioral coverage; they just guarantee that routine source updates break
CI and cost engineering time to "fix."

**Do not write:**

```python
# catalog snapshot — breaks every model release
assert "gemini-2.5-pro" in _PROVIDER_MODELS["gemini"]
assert "MiniMax-M2.7" in models

# config version literal — breaks every schema bump
assert DEFAULT_CONFIG["_config_version"] == 21

# enumeration count — breaks every time a skill/provider is added
assert len(_PROVIDER_MODELS["huggingface"]) == 8
```

**Do write:**

```python
# behavior: does the catalog plumbing work at all?
assert "gemini" in _PROVIDER_MODELS
assert len(_PROVIDER_MODELS["gemini"]) >= 1

# behavior: does migration bump the user's version to current latest?
assert raw["_config_version"] == DEFAULT_CONFIG["_config_version"]

# invariant: no plan-only model leaks into the legacy list
assert not (set(moonshot_models) & coding_plan_only_models)

# invariant: every model in the catalog has a context-length entry
for m in _PROVIDER_MODELS["huggingface"]:
    assert m.lower() in DEFAULT_CONTEXT_LENGTHS_LOWER
```

The rule: if the test reads like a snapshot of current data, delete it. If
it reads like a contract about how two pieces of data must relate, keep it.
When a PR adds a new provider/model and you want a test, make the test
assert the relationship (e.g. "catalog entries all have context lengths"),
not the specific names.

Reviewers should reject new change-detector tests; authors should convert
them into invariants before re-requesting review.
