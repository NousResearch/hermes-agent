## Important Policies

### Prompt Caching Must Not Break

Hermes-Agent ensures caching remains valid throughout a conversation. **Do NOT implement changes that would:**
- Alter past context mid-conversation
- Change toolsets mid-conversation
- Reload memories or rebuild system prompts mid-conversation

Cache-breaking forces dramatically higher costs. The ONLY time we alter context is during context compression.

Slash commands that mutate system-prompt state (skills, tools, memory, etc.)
must be **cache-aware**: default to deferred invalidation (change takes
effect next session), with an opt-in `--now` flag for immediate
invalidation. See `/skills install --now` for the canonical pattern.

### Background Process Notifications (Gateway)

When `terminal(background=true, notify_on_complete=true)` is used, the gateway runs a watcher that
detects process completion and triggers a new agent turn. Control verbosity of background process
messages with `display.background_process_notifications`
in config.yaml (or `HERMES_BACKGROUND_NOTIFICATIONS` env var):

- `all` — running-output updates + final message (default)
- `result` — only the final completion message
- `error` — only the final message when exit code != 0
- `off` — no watcher messages at all

## Profiles: Multi-Instance Support

Hermes supports **profiles** — multiple fully isolated instances, each with its own
`HERMES_HOME` directory (config, API keys, memory, sessions, skills, gateway, etc.).

The core mechanism: `_apply_profile_override()` in `hermes_cli/main.py` sets
`HERMES_HOME` before any module imports. All `get_hermes_home()` references
automatically scope to the active profile.

### Rules for profile-safe code

1. **Use `get_hermes_home()` for all HERMES_HOME paths.** Import from `hermes_constants`.
   NEVER hardcode `~/.hermes` or `Path.home() / ".hermes"` in code that reads/writes state.
   ```python
   # GOOD
   from hermes_constants import get_hermes_home
   config_path = get_hermes_home() / "config.yaml"

   # BAD — breaks profiles
   config_path = Path.home() / ".hermes" / "config.yaml"
   ```

2. **Use `display_hermes_home()` for user-facing messages.** Import from `hermes_constants`.
   This returns `~/.hermes` for default or `~/.hermes/profiles/<name>` for profiles.
   ```python
   # GOOD
   from hermes_constants import display_hermes_home
   print(f"Config saved to {display_hermes_home()}/config.yaml")

   # BAD — shows wrong path for profiles
   print("Config saved to ~/.hermes/config.yaml")
   ```

3. **Module-level constants are fine** — they cache `get_hermes_home()` at import time,
   which is AFTER `_apply_profile_override()` sets the env var. Just use `get_hermes_home()`,
   not `Path.home() / ".hermes"`.

4. **Tests that mock `Path.home()` must also set `HERMES_HOME`** — since code now uses
   `get_hermes_home()` (reads env var), not `Path.home() / ".hermes"`:
   ```python
   with patch.object(Path, "home", return_value=tmp_path), \
        patch.dict(os.environ, {"HERMES_HOME": str(tmp_path / ".hermes")}):
       ...
   ```

5. **Gateway platform adapters should use token locks** — if the adapter connects with
   a unique credential (bot token, API key), call `acquire_scoped_lock()` from
   `gateway.status` in the `connect()`/`start()` method and `release_scoped_lock()` in
   `disconnect()`/`stop()`. This prevents two profiles from using the same credential.
   See `plugins/platforms/irc/adapter.py` for the canonical pattern.

6. **Profile operations are HOME-anchored, not HERMES_HOME-anchored** — `_get_profiles_root()`
   returns `Path.home() / ".hermes" / "profiles"`, NOT `get_hermes_home() / "profiles"`.
   This is intentional — it lets `hermes -p coder profile list` see all profiles regardless
   of which one is active.

## Known Pitfalls

### DO NOT hardcode `~/.hermes` paths
Use `get_hermes_home()` from `hermes_constants` for code paths. Use `display_hermes_home()`
for user-facing print/log messages. Hardcoding `~/.hermes` breaks profiles — each profile
has its own `HERMES_HOME` directory. This was the source of 5 bugs fixed in PR #3575.

### DO NOT introduce new `simple_term_menu` usage
Existing call sites in `hermes_cli/main.py` remain for legacy fallback only;
the preferred UI is curses (stdlib) because `simple_term_menu` has
ghost-duplication rendering bugs in tmux/iTerm2 with arrow keys. New
interactive menus must use `hermes_cli/curses_ui.py` — see
`hermes_cli/tools_config.py` for the canonical pattern.

### DO NOT use `\033[K` (ANSI erase-to-EOL) in spinner/display code
Leaks as literal `?[K` text under `prompt_toolkit`'s `patch_stdout`. Use space-padding: `f"\r{line}{' ' * pad}"`.

### `_last_resolved_tool_names` is a process-global in `model_tools.py`
`_run_single_child()` in `delegate_tool.py` saves and restores this global around subagent execution. If you add new code that reads this global, be aware it may be temporarily stale during child agent runs.

### DO NOT hardcode cross-tool references in schema descriptions
Tool schema descriptions must not mention tools from other toolsets by name (e.g., `browser_navigate` saying "prefer web_search"). Those tools may be unavailable (missing API keys, disabled toolset), causing the model to hallucinate calls to non-existent tools. If a cross-reference is needed, add it dynamically in `get_tool_definitions()` in `model_tools.py` — see the `browser_navigate` / `execute_code` post-processing blocks for the pattern.

### The gateway has TWO message guards — both must bypass approval/control commands
When an agent is running, messages pass through two sequential guards:
(1) **base adapter** (`gateway/platforms/base.py`) queues messages in
`_pending_messages` when `session_key in self._active_sessions`, and
(2) **gateway runner** (`gateway/run.py`) intercepts `/stop`, `/new`,
`/queue`, `/status`, `/approve`, `/deny` before they reach
`running_agent.interrupt()`. Any new command that must reach the runner
while the agent is blocked (e.g. approval prompts) MUST bypass BOTH
guards and be dispatched inline, not via `_process_message_background()`
(which races session lifecycle).

### Squash merges from stale branches silently revert recent fixes
Before squash-merging a PR, ensure the branch is up to date with `main`
(`git fetch origin main && git reset --hard origin/main` in the worktree,
then re-apply the PR's commits). A stale branch's version of an unrelated
file will silently overwrite recent fixes on main when squashed. Verify
with `git diff HEAD~1..HEAD` after merging — unexpected deletions are a
red flag.

### Don't wire in dead code without E2E validation
Unused code that was never shipped was dead for a reason. Before wiring an
unused module into a live code path, E2E test the real resolution chain
with actual imports (not mocks) against a temp `HERMES_HOME`.

### Tests must not write to `~/.hermes/`
The `_isolate_hermes_home` autouse fixture in `tests/conftest.py` redirects `HERMES_HOME` to a temp dir. Never hardcode `~/.hermes/` paths in tests.

**Profile tests**: When testing profile features, also mock `Path.home()` so that
`_get_profiles_root()` and `_get_default_hermes_home()` resolve within the temp dir.
Use the pattern from `tests/hermes_cli/test_profiles.py`:
```python
@pytest.fixture
def profile_env(tmp_path, monkeypatch):
    home = tmp_path / ".hermes"
    home.mkdir()
    monkeypatch.setattr(Path, "home", lambda: tmp_path)
    monkeypatch.setenv("HERMES_HOME", str(home))
    return home
```

## Testing

**ALWAYS use `scripts/run_tests.sh`** — do not call `pytest` directly. The script enforces
hermetic environment parity with CI (unset credential vars, TZ=UTC, LANG=C.UTF-8,
`-n auto` xdist workers, in-tree subprocess-isolation plugin). Direct `pytest`
on a 16+ core developer machine with API keys set diverges from CI in ways
that have caused multiple "works locally, fails in CI" incidents (and the reverse).

```bash
scripts/run_tests.sh                                  # full suite, CI-parity
scripts/run_tests.sh tests/gateway/                   # one directory
scripts/run_tests.sh tests/agent/test_foo.py::test_x  # one test
scripts/run_tests.sh -v --tb=long                     # pass-through pytest flags
```

### Subprocess-per-test-file isolation

Every test file runs in a freshly-spawned Python subprocess via `run_tests_parallel.py`. This means module-level dicts/sets and
ContextVars from one test file cannot leak into the next.

### Why the wrapper

|                     | Without wrapper                             | With wrapper                              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Provider API keys   | Whatever is in your env (auto-detects pool) | All env vars except a specific few unset. |
| HOME / `~/.hermes/` | Your real config+auth.json                  | Temp dir per test                         |
| Timezone            | Local TZ (PDT etc.)                         | UTC                                       |
| Locale              | Whatever is set                             | C.UTF-8                                   |


### Don't write change-detector tests

A test is a **change-detector** if it fails whenever data that is **expected
to change** gets updated — model catalogs, config version numbers,
enumeration counts, hardcoded lists of provider models. These tests add no
behavioral coverage; they just guarantee that routine source updates break
CI and cost engineering time to "fix."

**Do not write:**

```python
# catalog snapshot — breaks every model release
assert "gemini-2.5-pro" in _PROVIDER_MODELS["gemini"]
assert "MiniMax-M2.7" in models

# config version literal — breaks every schema bump
assert DEFAULT_CONFIG["_config_version"] == 21

# enumeration count — breaks every time a skill/provider is added
assert len(_PROVIDER_MODELS["huggingface"]) == 8
```

**Do write:**

```python
# behavior: does the catalog plumbing work at all?
assert "gemini" in _PROVIDER_MODELS
assert len(_PROVIDER_MODELS["gemini"]) >= 1

# behavior: does migration bump the user's version to current latest?
assert raw["_config_version"] == DEFAULT_CONFIG["_config_version"]

# invariant: no plan-only model leaks into the legacy list
assert not (set(moonshot_models) & coding_plan_only_models)

# invariant: every model in the catalog has a context-length entry
for m in _PROVIDER_MODELS["huggingface"]:
    assert m.lower() in DEFAULT_CONTEXT_LENGTHS_LOWER
```

The rule: if the test reads like a snapshot of current data, delete it. If
it reads like a contract about how two pieces of data must relate, keep it.
When a PR adds a new provider/model and you want a test, make the test
assert the relationship (e.g. "catalog entries all have context lengths"),
not the specific names.

Reviewers should reject new change-detector tests; authors should convert
them into invariants before re-requesting review.
