# Hermes AI Office — NEXT

Last updated: 2026-05-09 13:03 KST

## Start here after `/new`

1. Load relevant skills if needed:
   - `hermes-agent`
   - `writing-plans`
   - `plan` if staying planning-only
   - `kanban-orchestrator` only if creating/organizing board tasks is explicitly approved
2. Read this file.
3. Read `STATUS.md`.
4. Read the latest Stage 5 outputs:
   - `docs/ai-office/architecture/backend-api.md`
   - `docs/ai-office/architecture/data-adapters.md`
   - `docs/ai-office/architecture/frontend-components.md`
   - `docs/ai-office/architecture/test-plan.md`
   - `docs/ai-office/architecture/rollout-plan.md`
   - `docs/ai-office/architecture/pixel-renderer-adapter.md`
5. If needed for provenance/routing context, then read the Stage 4 outputs:
   - `docs/ai-office/design/topic-registry-spec.md`
   - `docs/ai-office/design/task-provenance-metadata.md`
   - `docs/ai-office/design/provenance-backfill.md`
   - `docs/ai-office/design/privacy-security.md`
6. If needed for product context, then read the Stage 3 outputs:
   - `docs/ai-office/product/user-stories.md`
   - `docs/ai-office/architecture/office-state-model.md`
   - `docs/ai-office/product/information-architecture.md`
   - `docs/ai-office/product/non-goals-and-mutation-boundary.md`
   - `docs/ai-office/product/mvp-acceptance-criteria.md`
7. Do not implement dashboard code unless the user explicitly approves an implementation stage.
8. Continue from the `Current next stage` below.

## Suggested `/goal` for a fresh session

Use `/goal` as a session-level guardrail and progress judge, not as the durable project memory. Durable state still lives in `STATUS.md`, `NEXT.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `OPEN-QUESTIONS.md`, and stage output docs.

Default planning-mode goal:

```text
/goal Hermes AI Office / Pixel Agents style dashboard project를 구현하지 말고, 먼저 충분한 리서치·제품기획·아키텍처·단계별 실행계획·리스크·MVP 범위를 문서화한다. 각 단계는 STATUS/NEXT handoff를 남겨 /new 후에도 이어갈 수 있게 하고, 실제 코드 구현·서비스 재시작·설정 변경은 사용자가 명시적으로 승인하기 전까지 하지 않는다.
```

Stage 8/manual smoke goal suggestion, use only after explicit approval:

```text
/goal Hermes AI Office next stage를 승인된 범위 안에서 진행한다. 우선 Stage 8-A까지 완료된 read-only MVP diff와 /office 화면을 수동 smoke test하거나 다음 비픽셀 시각 polish를 한다. mutation controls, service restart, config/systemd change, Kanban/cron mutation, topic registry write, pixel renderer/dependency 추가는 하지 않는다. 검증 결과와 남은 open question을 STATUS/NEXT에 갱신한다.
```

When `/goal` is most useful:

1. Beginning a fresh `/new` session for one bounded stage, especially Stage 3–5 planning/design.
2. Long source-reading or synthesis sessions where the agent may otherwise drift into implementation.
3. Before any Stage 6+ implementation session, to enforce the approved scope and stop after the planned verification.
4. For multi-turn review loops: keep `/goal` active while drafting, reviewing, and tightening one deliverable set.

When not to rely on `/goal` alone:

1. Cross-session memory: use `STATUS.md`/`NEXT.md` instead.
2. Fine-grained coding task tracking: use a written plan and, after approval, Kanban/subagent workflow.
3. Background scheduled monitoring: use cron, not `/goal`.
4. Any mutation approval: `/goal` does not replace explicit user approval for code/config/service/Kanban/cron changes.

## Current next stage

Stage 9-E Korean-first readability pass, Stage 9-F browser-local dynamic tracking through Stage 9-F4, Stage 9-G fixture/source-health hardening, Stage 9-I DeskRPG-like CSS marker motion, Stage 10-A RPG character projection, Stage 10-B CSS/SVG character presentation, Stage 10-C safe role action chips, Stage 10-D room-to-room RPG route choreography, Stage 10-E safe character inspector, Stage 10-F usability hardening, Stage 10-G density/readability modes, Stage 10-H keyboard jump targets, Stage 11-A renderer evidence, and Stage 11-B CSS/SVG layout-density polish are implemented on top of Stage 9-D and the Stage 8 read-only dashboard. Stage 8-A/B/C and Stage 9-A/B/C/D remain completed and verified.


Stage 9-E current implementation:

- `/office` primary UI copy is now Korean-first: headings, focus buttons, refresh/inspect actions, empty states, safety copy, status labels, room labels, and inspector field labels.
- Technical identifiers remain visible where useful: DTO, OfficeState, source IDs, cron, IDs, and adapter-emitted status strings.
- Planning note for the next dynamic/tracking pass: `docs/ai-office/plans/2026-05-09-koreanization-and-dynamic-map.md`.

Stage 9-F current implementation:

- `buildOfficeStateDelta(previous, next)` compares only safe browser-local counts/statuses and attention count.
- Office-map room cards now show last-refresh `+N`, `-N`, and `상태 변경` badges.
- The map card now has a compact `최근 변화` rail backed by a small duplicate-collapsed in-memory ring buffer.
- Stage 9-F3 adds safe flow-level change hints plus `방금 변경` text in the flow legend.
- Stage 9-F3 adds explicit browser-tab-local live controls: `실시간 추적 켜기` and `실시간 추적 일시정지`, polling the same read-only OfficeState endpoint every 30 seconds only while enabled.
- Stage 9-F4 adds automation next-run timing buckets (`overdue`, `<15m`, `<1h`, `today`, `later`, `unknown`) and emits safe `일정 변경` / `자동화 다음 실행 ...` deltas.
- Stage 9-F4 changes live tracking from fixed interval to browser-local adaptive timeouts: visible/no failures 30 seconds, hidden or one failure 60 seconds, repeated failures 120 seconds.
- Stage 9-G adds source-health summary and centralized empty-state hints, including explicit `사용 불가` source counts and safe missing-source labels.
- Stage 9-I adds DeskRPG-like CSS marker motion: safe scene markers now walk/idle/blink with reduced-motion fallback, no renderer dependency, no sprite assets, and no DeskRPG code/assets.
- Stage 10-A adds RPG character projection: `OfficeCharacter`, `buildOfficeCharacters(state, nodes)`, and `buildOfficeCharacterSceneObjects(characters)` turn safe DTO counts/status/source health into generic Korean role characters (`모델 캐릭터`, `작업자`, `자동화 관리인`, `전달자`, `감시자`, `경보 담당`) before rendering markers.
- Stage 10-B adds original CSS/SVG-like character presentation: `OfficeCharacterView` and `buildOfficeCharacterView(character)` produce safe role glyphs, Korean nameplates/status labels, and CSS classes; `OfficeCharacterMarker` renders layered head/body/accessory/status-light shapes with `data-office-character-role` smoke hooks.
- Stage 10-C adds safe action chips: `OfficeCharacterActivity` and `buildOfficeCharacterActivity(character, delta)` derive Korean labels such as `생각 중`, `예약 대기`, `확인 필요`, and `막힘` from role/status plus room/flow deltas only; `OfficeCharacterMarker` exposes `data-office-character-activity` for smoke testing.
- Stage 10-D adds room-to-room RPG route choreography: `OfficeCharacterRoute` and `buildOfficeCharacterRoutes(delta)` derive only from `OfficeStateDelta.changedFlows`, render decorative route hints with static `흐름 변경` labels, and disable route animations under reduced motion.
- Stage 10-E adds safe character inspection: `OfficeCharacterInspector` and `buildOfficeCharacterInspector(character, delta)` generate keyboard/ARIA-friendly inspector fields (`캐릭터`, `역할`, `방`, `상태`, `액션`, `최근 안전 변화`, `가림`) from role/status/safe delta only; character buttons expose `data-office-character-inspect`.
- Stage 10-F adds usability hardening: `OfficeUsabilitySummary` and `buildOfficeUsabilitySummary(state, characters, options)` surface dense-state aggregation, missing/partial source fallback, reduced-motion static meaning, responsive layout posture, and Korean-first copy in a safe map rail with `data-office-usability` smoke hooks.
- Stage 10-G adds local density/readability modes: `OfficeMapDensityMode`, `OfficeMapDensityPlan`, and `buildOfficeMapDensityPlan(mode, characters)` derive 요약/표준/상세 display plans, cap visible generated characters, expose `data-office-density-controls`, and fold the recent-change rail only in 요약 mode.
- Stage 10-H adds safe keyboard jump targets: `OfficeMapJumpTarget` and `buildOfficeMapJumpTargets(densityPlan)` expose 지도/사용성/최근 변화/안전 정보 quick links with stable focusable section anchors and summary-mode collapsed recent rail targeting.
- First snapshots produce no fabricated history; manual refresh remains the default.
- Planning note expanded: `docs/ai-office/plans/2026-05-09-koreanization-and-dynamic-map.md`.

Recommended next implementation/design stage: Stage 11-C should be a verification/decision checkpoint or another small CSS/SVG readability polish only if browser evidence still shows crowding after Stage 11-B. Stage 11-A found a safe functional page with borderline density/crowding, and Stage 11-B addressed that with compact/minimal nameplates plus a detached lower legend; neither stage found a measured need for PixiJS/Phaser/canvas. Do not expose individual task identity, generate content-like speech bubbles, add character mutation targets, or add Phaser, PixiJS, canvas, sprite assets, DeskRPG code/assets, backend/schema/API changes, mutation controls, persistent storage, or raw record projection. Stage 11 remains the separate renderer decision gate.

Stage 9-D completed:

- `web/src/pages/officeView.ts` adds `OfficeSceneObjectView` and `buildOfficeSceneObjectView(object)` so marker glyph/title/tone/accessibility presentation is testable.
- `web/src/pages/OfficePage.tsx` improves room-card contrast, marker hierarchy, focus rings, SVG/zone/legend z-index layering, and bottom legend spacing.
- `web/src/pages/OfficePage.test.ts` covers non-interactive marker presentation and raw-field avoidance.
- Still no PixiJS/Phaser, canvas engine, sprite assets, copied DeskRPG code/assets, new dependency, backend route/schema, or mutation controls.

```

## Immediate next action

Immediate next action should remain a product/UX decision point, not a control-plane expansion:

1. Stage 11-C decision checkpoint: decide whether to stop renderer work for now or do one more tiny CSS/SVG readability pass based on fresh browser evidence.
2. Renderer decision: keep CSS/SVG by default; Stage 11-A/B did not record a measured performance/functional gap that justifies a renderer spike.
3. Test-harness review: consider React DOM coverage for polling cleanup/pause behavior only if adding/standardizing that harness is separately approved.
4. Renderer research: only after future evidence proves CSS/SVG is insufficient and after separate dependency/licensing/security/accessibility review, decide whether Phaser/PixiJS is worth the bundle/maintenance cost.
5. Do not add mutation controls, expose dashboard remotely, add Pixi/Phaser/canvas, copy DeskRPG assets/code, create/edit topic registry data, or create/modify Kanban/Cron state without separate approval.

```

Notes:

- `npm run lint` for the whole web app now passes with 0 errors and 20 warnings after downgrading React Compiler migration rules to warnings and fixing two unused variables.
- Full Python `scripts/run_tests.sh -q --tb=short` is green after the cleanup batches: 20886 passed, 125 skipped, 232 warnings in 389.83s.
- `test_update_yes_flag` no longer appears in the latest full xdist failure list after patching through `cmd_update.__globals__`.
- `web/package.json` has no `test` script, so `npm test` is not available.
- The ACP import-error cluster was an environment gap; local `.venv` now has `agent-client-protocol 0.10.0` via `python -m pip install -e '.[acp]'`.
- Installing only `.[web]` initially left existing PTY WebSocket tests failing because `ptyprocess` was missing; installing existing `.[pty]` fixed those tests.
- Starlette 1.0.0 caused WebSocket TestClient frame incompatibilities in existing PTY tests, so `pyproject.toml` now constrains the web extra to `starlette<1` and local verification used Starlette 0.52.1.
- Remaining backend warnings are existing Python `pty.py` `forkpty()` deprecation warnings in PTY tests.

- Do not add npm/Python dependencies unless explicitly approved.
- Do not create or mutate Kanban boards/tasks unless explicitly approved.
- Do not create, pause, resume, trigger, delete, or mutate cron jobs from AI Office.
- Do not restart services.
- Do not change gateway/cron/config/systemd/startup scripts.
- Do not write to NAS/Obsidian shared ledger.
- Do not vendor/fork Pixel Agents code.
- Do not create/edit `~/.hermes/office/topics.json` unless the user explicitly approves a registry seed/edit step.

## Handoff checklist before next `/new`

Before starting a fresh session:

1. Read this file and `STATUS.md`.
2. Read the Stage 5 architecture docs listed above.
3. If the user approves the next stage, begin only with the approved smoke-test/polish/lint-cleanup scope and update handoff files after verification.
4. If no approval is given, stay in review/planning mode.
5. State explicitly what was not changed.
