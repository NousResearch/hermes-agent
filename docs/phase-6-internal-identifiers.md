# Phase 6 — Internal Identifier Rebrand (backward-compatible)

**Status:** In progress — the alias foundation, entrypoint hardening, and the
backward-compatible `~/.hermes` → `~/.ht-ai-agent` data-dir migration have
landed; the Python module renames remain a deferred follow-up increment.

Phase 6 rebrands the fork's **load-bearing internal identifiers** from the
`Hermes` name to `HT`. Unlike Phases 1–5 (user-visible surfaces, safe to change
outright), these identifiers are inter-process, on-disk, and third-party-client
contracts:

- `HERMES_*` environment variables (~329, many are launcher⇄gateway protocol)
- the `~/.hermes` data directory (holds every user's sessions, skills, memory)
- `X-Hermes-*` HTTP headers (read/written by external OpenAI-compatible clients)
- Python module names (`hermes_cli`, `hermes_state`, `hermes_constants`, …)

The chosen strategy is **backward-compatible migration**: introduce the new
`HT_*` / `X-HT-*` names *additively*, keep the legacy names working, and never
break a running install or an existing client.

## What has landed (this increment)

A single, dependency-free compatibility module, `ht_compat.py`, plus the wiring
that makes both namespaces equivalent.

### Environment variables — `HERMES_*` ⇆ `HT_*`

`ht_compat.mirror_brand_env()` mirrors the two namespaces by a pure **prefix
rule** (`HERMES_FOO` ⇆ `HT_FOO`), so all ~329 vars are covered without an
enumerated table that would drift. It is:

- **non-clobbering** — a counterpart is only filled when absent, so setting both
  keeps both;
- **idempotent** — running twice changes nothing;
- **bidirectional** — set either name, the other appears.

It runs once at process startup — at every standalone entrypoint, not just the
CLI — so both names resolve process-wide and every spawned subprocess inherits
both:

  * `hermes_cli/main.py:main` (the `ht` / `hermes` CLI; the gateway and MCP
    server run in-process under it, so they are covered too),
  * `run_agent.py:main` (the `hermes-agent` console script),
  * `acp_adapter/entry.py:main` (the `hermes-acp` console script),
  * `batch_runner.py` `__main__` (`python batch_runner.py`).

Each uses the same guarded, idempotent call, so an `HT_*`-only environment works
even when these are launched directly rather than as a child of the CLI.

`ht_compat.resolve_env(name, default)` reads a single var honouring both
spellings, with the new `HT_*` value winning when both are set. `hermes_constants`
uses it directly for the load-bearing path vars so they resolve correctly even
before `mirror_brand_env` runs (it is called at import time from 30+ sites):

| Legacy | New alias |
|---|---|
| `HERMES_HOME` | `HT_HOME` |
| `HERMES_REAL_HOME` | `HT_REAL_HOME` |
| `HERMES_OPTIONAL_SKILLS` | `HT_OPTIONAL_SKILLS` |
| `HERMES_OPTIONAL_MCPS` | `HT_OPTIONAL_MCPS` |
| `HERMES_BUNDLED_SKILLS` | `HT_BUNDLED_SKILLS` |
| `HERMES_NODE_TARGET_MAJOR` | `HT_NODE_TARGET_MAJOR` |
| …all other `HERMES_*` | …`HT_*` (via `mirror_brand_env`) |

`gateway/status.py` (which keeps its own process-level home resolver) reads the
alias too.

### HTTP headers — `X-Hermes-*` ⇆ `X-HT-*`

Same prefix rule via `mirror_brand_headers()` (dual-emit) and
`read_brand_header()` (dual-read). Wired into:

- **`gateway/platforms/api_server.py`** (the OpenAI-compatible API — the
  third-party contract): every response now carries both `X-Hermes-*` and
  `X-HT-*` for `Session-Id`, `Session-Key`, `Completed`, `Partial`, `Error`;
  request ingestion accepts either spelling of `Session-Id` / `Session-Key`.
- **`hermes_cli/web_server.py`**: the loopback dashboard auth header accepts
  both `X-HT-Session-Token` and `X-Hermes-Session-Token`.

Legacy `X-Hermes-*` headers are always preserved, so existing clients are
unaffected; the mirror is additive and non-clobbering.

### Tests

- `tests/test_ht_compat.py` — full unit coverage of the mapping, env mirror, and
  header helpers (precedence, non-clobbering, idempotence, case-insensitivity).
- `tests/test_hermes_constants.py::TestHtHomeAlias` — `HT_HOME` precedence /
  fallback / equivalence with `HERMES_HOME`.
- `tests/gateway/test_session_api.py::test_session_chat_accepts_ht_headers_and_mirrors_them`
  — end-to-end: a request sent with only `X-HT-Session-Key` is honoured and the
  response carries both header spellings.

## Physical `~/.hermes` → `~/.ht-ai-agent` data-dir migration (landed)

The on-disk default is now the HT-branded `~/.ht-ai-agent` (POSIX) /
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\ht-ai-agent` (Windows), with a backward-compatible migration.

**Resolver** (`_get_platform_default_hermes_home`, side-effect-free — safe to
call at import from 30+ sites): prefer `~/.ht-ai-agent` if it exists, else an
existing legacy `~/.hermes` *in place* (so an un-migrated install never loses
its home), else the new location for fresh installs. Env resolution is unchanged
and still legacy-authoritative (`HT_HOME` → `HERMES_HOME` → default).

**Migration** (`maybe_migrate_home`, explicit, run once from CLI startup —
never at import): reconciles the default dir:
- *Existing install* (`~/.hermes` is a populated real dir): atomic `os.rename`
  to `~/.ht-ai-agent` + a back-compat symlink `~/.hermes → ~/.ht-ai-agent`.
  All-or-nothing — if the rename or the symlink fails it rolls back and the
  legacy home stays authoritative, so data is never lost or half-moved.
- *Fresh install* (neither exists): create `~/.ht-ai-agent` and point
  `~/.hermes` at it via symlink.

Either way, the `~/.hermes → ~/.ht-ai-agent` symlink means the ~25 code paths
that still hardcode the legacy `os.environ.get("HERMES_HOME", ~/.hermes)`
fallback resolve to the **same** directory as `get_hermes_home()` — no split
data dir — without needing to touch each callsite. Migration skips entirely
when a home override is set (`HT_HOME`/`HERMES_HOME`/context override), when
`HT_SKIP_HOME_MIGRATION` is set, and under pytest (so tests never move real
dirs). On Windows without symlink privilege the migration rolls back / the
bridge is skipped (existing installs keep `~/.hermes`); the env alias still
works.

**Tests:** `tests/test_home_migration.py` covers the resolver preference,
atomic migrate-with-rollback, fresh-provision, and every `maybe_migrate_home`
guard; the bare-default assertions in `tests/test_hermes_constants.py` and
`tests/test_hermes_home_profile_warning.py` were updated to the new default.

**Fallback tidy-up:** the runtime sites that read `HERMES_HOME` from the
environment *directly* (bypassing `HT_HOME` and the profile contextvar override)
now route through `get_hermes_home()` — `agent/secret_sources/_cache.py` and the
node-bootstrap home in `hermes_cli/main.py`. Left as-is on purpose:
`hermes_cli/dashboard_auth/audit.py` (deliberately dependency-free to avoid an
early-import cycle) and the `except ImportError` fallbacks in `mcp_serve.py` /
`tools/mcp_oauth.py` / `hermes_cli/slack_cli.py` (their *primary* path already
uses `get_hermes_home()`; the hardcoded string only runs when the resolver
can't be imported). The remaining hardcoded `~/.hermes` fallbacks in `scripts/`,
`optional-skills/`, and some plugins are bridged by the `~/.hermes →
~/.ht-ai-agent` symlink for migrated and fresh installs, so they resolve to the
same directory without a callsite change.

## Module-name aliases (`ht_*` → `hermes_*`) — safe subset landed

The HT-branded names for the **top-level single-file modules** are importable
as aliases: `ht_constants`, `ht_state`, `ht_time`, `ht_logging`, `ht_bootstrap`.
Each is a thin shim that replaces itself in `sys.modules` with the real
`hermes_<name>` module, so `import ht_constants` and `import hermes_constants`
return the **same object** — no duplicate module state, singletons, or
isinstance surprises. `hermes_<name>` stays canonical (all internal code and any
pickled references keep using it); the alias just makes the new name work too.
They are declared in `[tool.setuptools] py-modules` so the wheel/image ship them
(guarded by `tests/test_module_aliases.py`).

**Deliberately not done — package aliasing / full internal rename.** Aliasing
the `hermes_cli` **package** (and the ~12,300 internal references) is *not*
safe as a thin shim: `import ht_cli.config` double-imports the submodule
(`ht_cli.config is not hermes_cli.config`), duplicating module state. Doing it
correctly needs a process-wide import hook (a `sys.meta_path` finder), which is
real risk in the hot path of every import for essentially no user-visible gain —
no code or user references the new module names. The full internal rename
remains a large, low-value pass to do only if there's a concrete reason.

## Left unchanged on purpose

The `hermes-tools` codex config key (written into users' `~/.codex/config.toml`),
the `hermes-agent` ACP registry id and OAuth `client_id`, and the "Nous Hermes"
model-family names are **identifiers other systems key on**, not branding —
renaming them breaks integrations for no user-visible gain. See the PR-1 rebrand
notes for the full list.
