# TypeScript Style

Applies to desktop, TUI, website, and future TypeScript packages. Read the
nearest area guide for its build and test commands.

Small nanostores over component state when state is shared or read by distant UI; each
feature owns its atoms (chat near chat, shared in `src/store`); rendering components use
`useStore`, non-rendering actions read `$atom.get()`; never thread state through three
components when the leaf can subscribe; persistence sits beside the atom that owns it. Route
roots stay thin (compose routes + shell, never controllers). No monolithic hooks — one narrow
job each; colocated action modules over god hooks. Pure side-effect callbacks use the terse
void form `onState={st => void setGatewayState(st)}`; async handlers make intent explicit
`onClick={() => void save()}`. Interfaces for public props and shared object shapes (not
`type X = {...}`); extend React primitives (`React.ComponentProps<'button'>`, `Omit`, `Pick`).
Table-driven beats condition ladders for ids/routes/views. `src/app` owns routes/pages,
`src/store` shared atoms, `src/lib` pure helpers.
