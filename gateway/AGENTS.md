# gateway governance

Read repository-root `AGENTS.md` and its required routing table before acting.
These are supplemental current-lineage rules, not exceptions to global rules.
Read this file completely; automatic hints may truncate it. Scope follows the
behavior affected, including tests, docs and callers outside this directory.

### Background Process Notifications (Gateway)

When `terminal(background=true, notify_on_complete=true)` is used, the gateway runs a watcher that
detects process completion and triggers a new agent turn. Control verbosity of background process
messages with `display.background_process_notifications`
in config.yaml (or `HERMES_BACKGROUND_NOTIFICATIONS` env var):

- `concise` — one-line status message on completion; failures append a short output tail (default)
- `all` — running-output updates + final raw-output message
- `result` — only the final raw-output completion message
- `error` — only the final raw-output message when exit code != 0
- `off` — no watcher messages at all

---

### The gateway has TWO message guards — both must bypass approval/control commands
When an agent is running, messages pass through two sequential guards:
(1) **base adapter** (`gateway/platforms/base.py`) queues messages in
`_pending_messages` when `session_key in self._active_sessions`, and
(2) **gateway runner** (`gateway/run.py`) intercepts `/stop`, `/new`,
`/queue`, `/status`, `/approve`, `/deny` before they reach
`running_agent.interrupt()`. Any new command that must reach the runner
while the agent is blocked (e.g. approval prompts) MUST bypass BOTH
guards and be dispatched inline, not via `_process_message_background()`
(which races session lifecycle).

### Streaming delivery contract (stream-is-the-message adapters) — duplicate-final class
Adapters with `draft_stream_is_message = True` (relay Slack native streaming)
keep ONE cumulative native stream per turn; the stream IS the final message.
Four invariants, each learned from a live duplicate-final incident (NS-658
canary ledger, hermes#85796 / gateway-gateway#210). Violating any of them
re-creates a duplicate or a frozen stream:

1. **Draft frames must be prefix-stable.** The connector computes append-only
   deltas: frame N must be a string prefix of frame N+1. NEVER mutate draft
   frames per-tick — no fence-closing (`ensure_closed_code_fences`), no cursor
   suffix, no segment-state resets at tool boundaries, no mrkdwn conversion.
   Any non-prefix frame triggers a whole-snapshot re-append on the platform
   ("stacked copies"). The finalize path may still transform the real final.
2. **The consumer declares the final; the adapter never guesses.**
   `finish(final_text)` carries the completed `final_response` (verifier
   footer, completion explainer included) as the authoritative finalize
   payload. New post-stream response augmentation MUST ride this payload —
   if it mutates `final_response` after the stream sealed, it re-opens the
   #11 bug (`delivered_final_matches` mismatch → corrective duplicate send).
3. **Interim sends must carry `_interim_send` metadata.** Any consumer-side
   `adapter.send()` that is NOT the turn-final (commentary, segment-tail
   flushes) must set `metadata["_interim_send"] = True`, or the relay
   adapter's seal-interception will seal the live stream with interim text.
   Seal-interception exists at BOTH egress doors (`send()` AND
   `send_for_platform()`); a new egress door needs the same two checks.
4. **Reconcile by edit, never by plain send.** Any lane that delivers a final
   beside an already-sealed stream (queued follow-ups, media-accompanied
   finals, future lanes) must first try `edit_message` on the consumer's
   `message_id`; plain `send()` is the fallback only when no editable message
   exists. A sealed native stream is a regular message — `chat.update` on it
   works (live-verified).

Contract tests: `tests/gateway/test_stream_final_contract.py` (all four
invariants, mutation-checked). Slack streaming API ground truth (live-probed,
also encoded in connector comments/tests): `chat.*Stream` speaks STANDARD
markdown, not mrkdwn; `stopStream.markdown_text` APPENDS (never replaces);
`startStream`/`stopStream` are rate-limit Tier 2 (~20/min).

Guard style note: check `draft_stream_is_message` with `is True` — MagicMock
adapters in older tests auto-create truthy attributes.
