"""Kanban board watcher methods for GatewayRunner.

Background loops that subscribe to kanban boards, deliver notifications and
artifacts, and drive the multi-agent dispatcher. They use only ``self`` state,
so they live on a mixin ``GatewayRunner`` inherits. Per-tick work lives in
``kanban_watchers_notifier`` / ``kanban_watchers_dispatcher``; shared plumbing
in ``kanban_watchers_common``.
