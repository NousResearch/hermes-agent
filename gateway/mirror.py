    turn — ``hermes send`` from a shell, another session, any out-of-band sender — finds the

    assistant→assistant pair that strict-alternation providers reject. ``repair_message_sequence``
    then merges the pair, and the merged turn no longer distinguishes the reply from the
    delivery: on a "Note to Self" chat the agent read its own send as the user's message and
    asked whether the user had sent it.

    cron and webhook deliveries avoid this by mirroring as ``role="user"`` with a labelled
    prefix (#2313, the failure #2221 documents); their text is not the agent speaking. This
    does the same only when the role would actually collide, so an in-turn mirror — whose tail

    Text that is NOT the agent speaking (e.g. a cron brief) must pass
    ``role="user"``: ``mirror`` metadata is dropped at the SQLite boundary, so an
