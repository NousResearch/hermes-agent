"""
Platform Adapter Registry

Allows platform adapters (built-in and plugin) to self-register so the gateway
can discover and instantiate them without hardcoded if/elif chains.

Built-in adapters continue to use the existing if/elif in _create_adapter()
for now.  Plugin adapters register here via PluginContext.register_platform()
and are looked up first -- if nothing is found the gateway falls through to
the legacy code path.

Usage (plugin side):

    from gateway.platform_registry import platform_registry, PlatformEntry

    platform_registry.register(PlatformEntry(
        name="irc",
        label="IRC",
        adapter_factory=lambda cfg: IRCAdapter(cfg),
        check_fn=check_requirements,
        validate_config=lambda cfg: bool(cfg.extra.get("server")),
        required_env=["IRC_SERVER"],
        install_hint="pip install irc",
    ))

Usage (gateway side):

    adapter = platform_registry.create_adapter("irc", platform_config)
