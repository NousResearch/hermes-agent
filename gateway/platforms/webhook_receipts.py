"""Durable webhook delivery receipts: one row per authenticated delivery, kept across restarts.

The receipt log answers two questions the in-process idempotency cache could not:

* **Was this delivery already accepted?** ``deliver_only``, ``cron_job`` and coalesced routes act
  before (or without) the session admission ledger, so their only replay guard used to be a 1-hour
  in-memory set. A claim row here (``claim = 1``, unique per profile/route/delivery id) survives a
  gateway restart, so a provider retry after a restart is answered as a duplicate instead of
  re-running the job or re-sending the message. A failed delivery releases its claim, so the
  provider's retry is processed.
* **What happened to it?** Every authenticated delivery (accepted, duplicate, ignored by the route's
  ``events``/``filters``/``script``, or failed) gets a row with the reason and a link to what it
  started (cron job, delivery target). Payload bodies are never stored. ``hermes webhook history``
  reads this file.

The database lives beside ``webhook_subscriptions.json`` in the gateway's home. Rows older than
``platforms.webhook.extra.receipt_retention_days`` (default 7) are pruned, and the history rows are
capped at ``MAX_HISTORY_ROWS`` so an authenticated flood cannot grow the file without bound.
