    read-only connection is not allowed to create or recover the shared-memory
    index.  That is exactly the shape of a database nothing currently holds
    open, so the read-only open fails precisely when the copy would otherwise
    succeed.  A read-write client can create/recover the -shm, and backup() over
    it is still a consistent snapshot, so retry read-write before giving up.

    Only the *open* is retried.  A source that is merely locked is handled by the

    second time over the same lock without being any more able to take it.
