    """Record a non-success outcome (spawn_failed / crashed / timed_out)
    and maybe trip the circuit breaker.

    Unified replacement for the old spawn-only ``_record_spawn_failure``.
    Every path that ends a task with a non-success outcome funnels
    through here so the ``consecutive_failures`` counter and the
    auto-block threshold stay consistent.

    Returns True when the task was auto-blocked (counter reached
    ``failure_limit``), False when it was just updated in place.

    Modes:

    * ``release_claim=True, end_run=True`` — spawn-failure path.
      Caller has a running task with an open run; this transitions
      it back to ``ready`` (or ``blocked`` when the breaker trips),
      releases the claim, and closes the run with ``outcome=<outcome>``.

    * ``release_claim=False, end_run=False`` — timeout/crash path.
      Caller has ALREADY flipped the task to ``ready`` and closed the
      run with the appropriate outcome. This just increments the
      counter; if the breaker trips, the task is re-transitioned
      ``ready → blocked`` and a ``gave_up`` event is emitted.

    ``event_payload_extra`` merges into the ``gave_up`` event payload
    when the breaker trips, so callers can include outcome-specific
    context (e.g. pid on crash, elapsed on timeout).

    Resolution order for the effective threshold:
      1. per-task ``max_retries`` if set (nothing else overrides)
      2. caller-supplied ``failure_limit`` (gateway passes the config
         value from ``kanban.failure_limit``; tests pass fixed values)
      3. ``DEFAULT_FAILURE_LIMIT``

    ``force_trip=True`` trips the breaker unconditionally, skipping the
    counter-vs-threshold comparison (the resolution order above is then
    only reported in the ``gave_up`` payload, not re-evaluated). Callers
    use it when they have already applied their own bounded-retry policy
    — e.g. the clean-exit protocol-violation streak in
    ``detect_crashed_workers``, which resolves the per-task
    ``max_retries`` override against the violation streak itself. The
    failure is still counted into ``consecutive_failures``.
