"""Persistent session goals — the Ralph loop for Hermes.

A goal is a free-form user objective that stays active across turns. After
each turn completes, a small judge call asks an auxiliary model "is this
goal satisfied by the assistant's last response?". If not, Hermes feeds a
continuation prompt back into the same session and keeps working until the
goal is done, turn budget is exhausted, the user pauses/clears it, or the
user sends a new message (which takes priority and pauses the goal loop).

State is persisted in SessionDB's ``state_meta`` table keyed by
``goal:<session_id>`` so ``/resume`` picks it up.

Design notes / invariants:

- The continuation prompt is just a normal user message appended to the
  session via ``run_conversation``. No system-prompt mutation, no toolset
  swap — prompt caching stays intact.
- Judge failures are fail-OPEN: ``continue``. A broken judge must not wedge
  progress; the turn budget is the backstop.
- When a real user message arrives mid-loop it preempts the continuation
  prompt and also pauses the goal loop for that turn (we still re-judge
  after, so if the user's message happens to complete the goal the judge
  will say ``done``).
- This module has zero hard dependency on ``cli.HermesCLI`` or the gateway
  runner — both wire the same ``GoalManager`` in.

Nothing in this module touches the agent's system prompt or toolset.

    template; otherwise behavior is identical to the original judge.

    """Drive a kanban worker through a Ralph-style goal loop.

    The dispatcher spawns a goal-mode worker exactly like a normal worker
    (``hermes -p <profile> chat -q "work kanban task <id>"``). The worker's
    first turn has already run by the time this is called; ``first_response``
    is that turn's reply. From here we:

    1. Check whether the worker already terminated the task (called
       ``kanban_complete`` / ``kanban_block``). If so, stop — nothing to do.
    2. Otherwise judge the latest response against ``goal_text`` (the card's
       title + body). ``continue`` → feed a continuation prompt and run
       another turn IN THE SAME SESSION via ``run_turn``. ``done`` but the
       task is still open → one explicit "call kanban_complete" nudge.
    3. When the turn budget is exhausted and the worker still hasn't
       terminated the task, ``block_fn`` is invoked so the card lands in a
       sticky ``blocked`` state for human review (NOT a silent exit).

    This function performs NO SessionDB persistence — a worker process is
    ephemeral, so the turn budget lives in a local counter. It is fully
    decoupled from the CLI for testability: callers inject ``run_turn``
    (str -> str), ``task_status_fn`` (() -> str|None), and ``block_fn``
    (reason: str -> None).

    Returns a decision dict: ``{"outcome", "turns_used", "reason"}`` where
    outcome is one of ``"completed_by_worker"``, ``"blocked_budget"``,
    ``"blocked_by_worker"``, or ``"stopped"``.
