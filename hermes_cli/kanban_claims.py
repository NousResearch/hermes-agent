"""Claim/lock lifecycle for the SQLite-backed Kanban board.

Extracted from ``hermes_cli/kanban_db.py`` (claim/lock lifecycle cluster:
``claim_task``, ``claim_review_task``, ``heartbeat_claim``,
``release_stale_claims``, ``reclaim_task``, ``reassign_task``) as part of the
kanban_db.py god-file decomposition (epic #78647, target #78632).  The six
function bodies are byte-identical to the source window (kanban_db.py lines
4226-4697 at pin 01a1037d1e); the only sanctioned deviation is a
function-local lazy import of each god-file helper -- the house pattern for
this virgin god file, required because ``kanban_db`` re-exports these names at
its bottom and a module-level import here would create an import cycle.

    A stale-by-TTL claim whose host-local worker PID is still alive is
    *extended* (with a ``claim_extended`` event) instead of being
    reclaimed. Reclaiming a live worker mid-flight produces the spawn-
    then-immediately-reclaim loop seen on slow models that spend longer
    than ``DEFAULT_CLAIM_TTL_SECONDS`` inside a single tool-free LLM
    call (#23025): no tool calls means no ``kanban_heartbeat``, even
    though the subprocess is healthy.

    Backstop (#29747 gap 3): if the worker's PID is still alive but its
    ``last_heartbeat_at`` is stale by more than
    ``DEFAULT_CLAIM_HEARTBEAT_MAX_STALE_SECONDS`` (1h), the worker has
    been making no observable progress and we reclaim anyway — even if
    ``_pid_alive`` is still true. This catches the wedged-in-a-logic-loop
    case where the process is technically running but accomplishing
    nothing. ``_touch_activity`` (run_agent.py) bridges chunk-level
    liveness into ``last_heartbeat_at`` via #31752, so any genuinely
    active worker keeps its heartbeat fresh as a side effect of normal
    API traffic. ``enforce_max_runtime`` and ``detect_crashed_workers``
    remain the upper bounds for genuinely wedged or dead workers.

    Returns the number of stale claims actually reclaimed (live-pid
    extensions don't count). Safe to call often.

    Unlike :func:`release_stale_claims` which only acts on tasks whose
    ``claim_expires`` has passed, this function reclaims immediately
    regardless of TTL. Intended for the dashboard/CLI recovery flow
    when an operator wants to abort a running worker without waiting
    for the TTL to expire (e.g. after seeing a hallucination warning).

    Returns True if a reclaim happened, False if the task isn't in a
    reclaimable state (not running, or doesn't exist).
