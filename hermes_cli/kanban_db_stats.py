"""Board statistics, split out of :mod:`hermes_cli.kanban_db`.

``kanban_db`` is a facade well past the repo's 2,000-line cap and may only get
smaller, so new behaviour never lands there: the pure query helpers that need
nothing but a connection live here and are re-exported at the tail of
``kanban_db`` (the same pattern as ``kanban_db_boards`` / ``kanban_db_dispatch``).

Nothing in this module imports ``kanban_db`` — every function takes the
connection it works on.
