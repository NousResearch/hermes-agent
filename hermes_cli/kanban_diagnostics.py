"""Kanban diagnostics — structured, actionable distress signals for tasks.

A ``Diagnostic`` is a machine-readable description of something that's wrong
with a kanban task: a hallucinated card id, a spawn crash-loop, a task
stuck blocked for too long, etc. Each one carries:

* A **kind** (canonical code; UI/tests match on this).
* A **severity** (``warning`` / ``error`` / ``critical``).
* A **title** (one-line human description) and **detail** (longer text).
* A list of **suggested actions** — structured entries the dashboard
  turns into buttons and the CLI turns into hints.

Rules run over (task, recent events, recent runs) and emit diagnostics.
They are stateless and read-only — no DB writes. Callers compute
diagnostics on demand (on ``/board`` load, ``/tasks/:id`` fetch, or
``hermes kanban diagnostics``).

Design goals:

* Fixable-on-the-operator's-side signals only (missing config, phantom
  ids, crash loop). Not "the provider returned 502 once" — that's a
  transient runtime blip, not a diagnostic.
* Recoverable: every diagnostic comes with at least one suggested
  recovery action the operator can actually take from the UI.
* Auto-clearing: when the underlying failure mode resolves (a clean
  ``completed`` event arrives, a spawn succeeds, the task gets
  unblocked), the diagnostic stops firing. The audit event trail stays.

    claiming it.

    Threshold: cfg["stranded_threshold_seconds"] (default 1800 = 30 min).

    Catches every "task waiting for a worker that never comes" case
    without caring WHY:

    * Operator typo'd the assignee — no profile or external worker matches.
    * Profile was deleted, leaving its tasks stranded.
    * External worker pool (Codex CLI, Claude Code lane, custom daemon)
      is down, hung, or wasn't started.
    * Dispatcher is misconfigured (wrong board, wrong HERMES_HOME).

    Pre-rule, all of these silently rotted in ``skipped_nonspawnable`` —
    the dispatcher correctly skipped them (good — no respawn loop) but
    nobody surfaced the fact that operator-actionable work was
    accumulating. The rule fires when a ready task's promoted-to-ready
    timestamp is older than the threshold AND the assignee is non-empty
    (truly unassigned tasks have their own ``skipped_unassigned`` signal
    on the dispatcher and a different operator response).

    The signal is age-based on purpose: it's identity-agnostic, so it
    works for Hermes profiles, registered lanes, external workers, and
    typos uniformly. No registry to curate, no per-board allowlist.
