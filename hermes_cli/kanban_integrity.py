"""Corrupt-DB detection / quarantine / auto-repair for :mod:`hermes_cli.kanban_db`.

Extracted verbatim from ``hermes_cli/kanban_db.py`` (wave-1 godfile
decomposition, shard s1, cluster c13 — ``kanban_integrity.py``). These are the
fail-closed guards that refuse to silently recreate a corrupt board file:
header probing, content-addressed quarantine backups with a retention cap,
``PRAGMA integrity_check``, and the narrow REINDEX auto-repair path.

Shared constants/helpers that the rest of the kanban module still uses
(``_SQLITE_HEADER``, ``_CORRUPT_BACKUP_RETENTION``, ``_INITIALIZED_PATHS``,
``_REPAIRABLE_INDEX_ERROR_PATTERNS``, ``_sqlite_connect``,
``KanbanDbCorruptError``, ``_log``) stay defined in ``hermes_cli.kanban_db``
and are imported at the bottom of this module.
