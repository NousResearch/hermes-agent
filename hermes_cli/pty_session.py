"""Keep-alive PTY sessions for dashboard terminals.

A PTY process outlives the WebSocket that created it: a single drain task
always reads the PTY into a bounded RingBuffer and forwards to the attached
socket when present. Reconnecting with the same opaque token replays the
buffer and resumes live. See
docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-20-pty-keepalive-reattach-design.md.
