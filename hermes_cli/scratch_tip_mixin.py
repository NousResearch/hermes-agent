"""First-use scratch-workspace tip helpers extracted from hermes_cli.kanban_db.

Wave-1 godfile decomposition of ``hermes_cli/kanban_db.py`` (shard s3,
cluster c9).  Every body here is a verbatim move from the original module;
``hermes_cli.kanban_db`` re-imports the public names at the bottom of that
file so the module-level API surface is unchanged.

Do not import this module directly - import through
:mod:`hermes_cli.kanban_db`.  This module imports shared helpers from
``kanban_db`` at module level, so the re-export imports in ``kanban_db``
must run after every definition they reference (they do; they sit at the
bottom of the file).

# Scratch workspaces are intentionally ephemeral — ``_cleanup_workspace``
# removes them as soon as ``complete_task`` runs.  New users often don't
# realize that and lose worker output (community report, May 2026).  The
# behavior is right; the lack of warning is the bug.
#
# On the FIRST scratch workspace materialization across the whole install
# we:
#   1. Log a warning line on the dispatcher logger.
#   2. Append a ``tip_scratch_workspace`` event on the task so it's visible
#      via ``hermes kanban show <id>`` and the dashboard.
#   3. Touch a sentinel file under ``kanban_home() / '.scratch_tip_shown'``
#      so we don't repeat the tip — once you know, you know.
#
# Scope is per-install, not per-board: a user creating a second board
# already learned the lesson on board #1.
