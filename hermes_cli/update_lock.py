"""Cross-process mutual exclusion for in-flight Hermes updates.

Three different surfaces can start an update of the same install tree:

* ``hermes update`` from a terminal,
* the dashboard's Update button (``POST /api/hermes/update`` →
  ``_spawn_hermes_action(["update"])``, detached),
* the desktop's Update button, which hands off to the Tauri
  ``hermes-setup --update`` and, on its failure screen, to install-mode
  bootstrap (``install.ps1`` / ``install.sh``).

Until now only the Tauri updater published an "update in progress" marker
(``UpdateMarkerGuard`` in ``apps/bootstrap-installer/src-tauri/src/update.rs``),
and only the Electron desktop consumed it (``electron/update-marker.ts``, to
gate local backend startup). Nothing stopped two *updaters* from running at
once — so a dashboard-spawned ``hermes update`` and an installer-driven
``git checkout`` could mutate the same checkout concurrently, rewriting source
under a live interpreter and leaving the tree half-updated.

This module makes that same marker the single lock for **all** update
entrypoints instead of adding a fourth mechanism. Format and location are
unchanged and remain byte-compatible with the Rust and Electron readers:

    <HERMES_HOME>/.hermes-update-in-progress   body: "<pid>\\n<started_at_unix>"

A marker only counts as a live update when its pid is alive AND it is younger
than :data:`UPDATE_MARKER_MAX_AGE_MS` — mirroring ``readLiveUpdateMarker`` so a
crashed updater self-heals instead of wedging every future update. A stale
marker is removed on read by whoever notices it first.
