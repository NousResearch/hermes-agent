"""
SQLite State Store for Hermes Agent.

Provides persistent session storage with FTS5 full-text search, replacing
the per-session JSONL file approach. Stores session metadata, full message
history, and model configuration for CLI and gateway sessions.

Key design decisions:
- WAL mode for concurrent readers + one writer (gateway multi-platform)
- FTS5 virtual table for fast text search across all session messages
- Compression-triggered session splitting via parent_session_id chains
- Batch runner and RL trajectories are NOT stored here (separate systems)
- Session source tagging ('cli', 'telegram', 'discord', etc.) for filtering

    # The race: ``conversation_compression.py`` rotates ``agent.session_id``
    # as a side effect of a successful compression (end old session, create
    # new). That mutation is local to the AIAgent instance — but ``state.db``
    # is shared across all instances. Two AIAgents that share the same
    # ``session_id`` at the moment they both decide to compress (most
    # commonly the parent turn's agent + a background-review fork started
    # right after the turn ended) each end the parent and create their own
    # NEW session, parented to the same old id. The gateway SessionEntry
    # only catches one rotation; the other child silently accumulates
    # writes — Damien's "parent → two orphan children" repro shape.
    #
    # The lock is keyed by ``session_id`` and is held for the duration of
    # the compress() call plus the rotation. ``holder`` identifies the
    # current owner (pid:tid:nonce) for diagnostics; the lock is recovered
    # via ``expires_at`` if the holder process crashed without releasing.

        twice in the replayed transcript.  Rewound rows are kept on
