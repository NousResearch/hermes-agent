# Agent Skills

**Production-grade engineering skills for AI coding agents.**

Skills encode the workflows, quality gates, and best practices that senior engineers use when building software. These ones are packaged so AI agents follow them consistently across every phase of development.

## Commands

7 slash commands that map to the development lifecycle. Each one activates the right skills automatically.

| What you're doing | Command | Key principle |
|-------------------|---------|---------------|
| Define what to build | `/spec` | Spec before code |
| Plan how to build it | `/plan` | Small, atomic tasks |
| Build incrementally | `/build` | One slice at a time |
| Prove it works | `/test` | Tests are proof |
| Review before merge | `/review` | Improve code health |
| Simplify the code | `/code-simplify` | Clarity over cleverness |
| Ship to production | `/ship` | Faster is safer |

Want fewer manual steps once the spec exists? **`/build auto`** generates the plan and implements every task in a single approved pass — you approve the plan once, then it runs autonomously. It removes the human stepping *between* tasks, not the verification: every task is still test-driven and committed individually, and it pauses on failures or risky steps.

Skills also activate automatically based on what you're doing — designing an API triggers `api-and-interface-design`, building UI triggers `frontend-ui-engineering`, and so on.

## All 24 Skills

The commands above are entry points. The pack includes 24 skills total — 23 lifecycle skills plus the `using-agent-skills` meta-skill. Each skill is a structured workflow with steps, verification gates, and anti-rationalization tables. You can also reference any skill directly.

### Meta - Discover which skill applies

| Skill | What It Does | Use When |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| [using-agent-skills](skills/using-agent-skills/SKILL.md) | Maps incoming work to the right skill workflow and defines shared operating rules | Starting a session or deciding which skill applies |

### Define - Clarify what to build

| Skill | What It Does | Use When |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| [interview-me](skills/interview-me/SKILL.md) | One-question-at-a-time interview that extracts what the user actually wants instead of what they think they should want, until ~95% confidence | The ask is underspecified, or the user invokes "interview me" / "grill me" |
| [idea-refine](skills/idea-refine/SKILL.md) | Structured divergent/convergent thinking to turn vague ideas into concrete proposals | You have a rough concept that needs exploration |
| [spec-driven-development](skills/spec-driven-development/SKILL.md) | Write a PRD covering objectives, commands, structure, code style, testing, and boundaries before any code | Starting a new project, feature, or significant change |

### Plan - Break it down

| Skill | What It Does | Use When |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| [planning-and-task-breakdown](skills/planning-and-task-breakdown/SKILL.md) | Decompose specs into small, verifiable tasks with acceptance criteria and dependency ordering | You have a spec and need implementable units |

### Build - Write the code

| Skill | What It Does | Use When |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| [incremental-implementation](skills/incremental-implementation/SKILL.md) | Thin vertical slices - implement, test, verify, commit. Feature flags, safe defaults, rollback-friendly changes | Any change touching more than one file |
| [test-driven-development](skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md) | Red-Green-Refactor, test pyramid (80/15/5), test sizes, DAMP over DRY, Beyonce Rule, browser testing | Implementing logic, fixing bugs, or changing behavior |

| [source-driven-development](skills/source-driven-development/SKILL.md) | Ground every framework decision in official documentation - verify, cite sources, flag what's unverified | You want authoritative, source-cited code for any framework or library |
| [doubt-driven-development](skills/doubt-driven-development/SKILL.md) | Adversarial fresh-context review of every non-trivial decision in-flight - CLAIM → EXTRACT → DOUBT → RECONCILE → STOP, with optional user-authorized cross-model escalation | Stakes are high (production, security, irreversible), working in unfamiliar code, or a confident output is cheaper to verify now than to debug later |
| [frontend-ui-engineering](skills/frontend-ui-engineering/SKILL.md) | Component architecture, design systems, state management, responsive design, WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility | Building or modifying user-facing interfaces |
| [api-and-interface-design](skills/api-and-interface-design/SKILL.md) | Contract-first design, Hyrum's Law, One-Version Rule, error semantics, boundary validation | Designing APIs, module boundaries, or public interfaces |

## How Skills Work

Every skill follows a consistent anatomy:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  SKILL.md                                       │
│                                                 │
│  ┌─ Frontmatter ─────────────────────────────┐  │
│  │ name: lowercase-hyphen-name               │  │

│  └───────────────────────────────────────────┘  │                                                                                                
│  Overview         → What this skill does        │
│  When to Use      → Triggering conditions       │
│  Process          → Step-by-step workflow       │
│  Rationalizations → Excuses + rebuttals         │
│  Red Flags        → Signs something's wrong     │
│  Verification     → Evidence requirements       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key design choices:**

- **Process, not prose.** Skills are workflows agents follow, not reference docs they read. Each has steps, checkpoints, and exit criteria.
- **Anti-rationalization.** Every skill includes a table of common excuses agents use to skip steps (e.g., "I'll add tests later") with documented counter-arguments.
- **Verification is non-negotiable.** Every skill ends with evidence requirements - tests passing, build output, runtime data. "Seems right" is never sufficient.
- **Progressive disclosure.** The `SKILL.md` is the entry point. Supporting references load only when needed, keeping token usage minimal.

## Why Agent Skills?

AI coding agents default to the shortest path - which often means skipping specs, tests, security reviews, and the practices that make software reliable. Agent Skills gives agents structured workflows that enforce the same discipline senior engineers bring to production code.

Each skill encodes hard-won engineering judgment: *when* to write a spec, *what* to test, *how* to review, and *when* to ship. These aren't generic prompts - they're the kind of opinionated, process-driven workflows that separate production-quality work from prototype-quality work.

Skills bake in best practices from Google's engineering culture — including concepts from [Software Engineering at Google](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book) and Google's [engineering practices guide](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/). You'll find Hyrum's Law in API design, the Beyonce Rule and test pyramid in testing, change sizing and review speed norms in code review, Chesterton's Fence in simplification, trunk-based development in git workflow, Shift Left and feature flags in CI/CD, and a dedicated deprecation skill treating code as a liability. These aren't abstract principles — they're embedded directly into the step-by-step workflows agents follow.

## Contributing

Skills should be **specific** (actionable steps, not vague advice), **verifiable** (clear exit criteria with evidence requirements), **battle-tested** (based on real workflows), and **minimal** (only what's needed to guide the agent).

See [docs/skill-anatomy.md](docs/skill-anatomy.md) for the format specification and [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.
