"""Kanban dashboard plugin — backend API routes.

Mounted at /api/plugins/kanban/ by the dashboard plugin system.

This layer is intentionally thin: every handler is a small wrapper around
``hermes_cli.kanban_db`` or a direct SQL query. Writes use the same code
paths the CLI and gateway ``/kanban`` command use, so the three surfaces
cannot drift.

Live updates arrive via the ``/events`` WebSocket, which tails the
append-only ``task_events`` table on a short poll interval (WAL mode lets
reads run alongside the dispatcher's IMMEDIATE write transactions).

Security note
-------------
Plugin HTTP routes go through the dashboard's session-token auth middleware
(``web_server.auth_middleware``) just like core API routes — every
``/api/plugins/...`` request must present the session bearer token (or the
session cookie set when you load the dashboard HTML). The token is the
random per-process ``_SESSION_TOKEN`` printed at startup; the dashboard's
own pages inject it via ``window.__HERMES_SESSION_TOKEN__`` so logged-in
browsers don't have to handle it manually.

For the ``/events`` WebSocket we still require the session token as a
``?token=`` query parameter (browsers cannot set the ``Authorization``
header on an upgrade request), matching the established pattern used by
the in-browser PTY bridge in ``hermes_cli/web_server.py``.

This means ``hermes dashboard --host 0.0.0.0`` is safe to run on a LAN:
plugin routes are no longer an unauthenticated exception. The auth still
isn't multi-user — anyone who can read the printed URL+token gets full
dashboard access — but they can't ride along just because they can reach
the port.
