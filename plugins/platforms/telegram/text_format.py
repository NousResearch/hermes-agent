"""Telegram MarkdownV2 text-formatting helpers for ``TelegramAdapter``.

Extracted verbatim from ``plugins/platforms/telegram/adapter.py`` as part of
the god-file decomposition campaign. These are pure functions (plus their
module-level compiled regexes) with no adapter state; ``adapter.py``
re-imports them so existing call sites and tests that import from the
adapter module keep working unchanged.

Behavior-neutral: bodies are character-for-character copies of the originals.
