#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Canonical test runner for hermes-agent. Run this instead of calling
# `pytest` directly to guarantee your local run matches CI behavior.
#
# What this script enforces:
#   * Per-file isolation via scripts/run_tests_parallel.py — each test
#     file runs in its own freshly-spawned `python -m pytest <file>`
#     subprocess. No xdist, no shared workers, no module-level leakage
#     between files.
#   * TZ=UTC, LANG=C.UTF-8, PYTHONHASHSEED=0 (deterministic)
#   * Env vars blanked (conftest.py also does this, but this
#     is belt-and-suspenders for anyone running pytest outside our
#     conftest path — e.g. on a single file)
#   * Proper venv activation (probes .venv, venv, then ~/.hermes/...)
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/run_tests.sh                            # full suite
#   scripts/run_tests.sh -j 4                       # cap parallelism
#   scripts/run_tests.sh tests/agent/               # discover only here
#   scripts/run_tests.sh tests/agent/ tests/acp_adapter/    # multiple roots
#   scripts/run_tests.sh tests/foo.py               # single file
#   scripts/run_tests.sh tests/foo.py -q            # path + bare pytest flag
#   scripts/run_tests.sh tests/foo.py -v --tb=long  # bare flags "just work"
#   scripts/run_tests.sh -k 'pattern'               # value flags pass through too
#   scripts/run_tests.sh tests/foo.py -- --tb=long  # explicit '--' still works
#
# Bare pytest flags (anything starting with '-' that isn't one of this
# runner's own options: -j/--jobs, --paths, --slice, --file-timeout, etc.)
# are forwarded to each per-file pytest invocation automatically — no '--'
# separator required. The explicit '--' form still works and stacks with
# bare flags. Positional path arguments override the default discovery
# root (tests/).

# ── Windows location variables (computed before we drop env) ───────────────
# `env -i` forwards HOME, which is enough on POSIX. Native Windows CPython
# resolves Path.home() from USERPROFILE (or HOMEDRIVE+HOMEPATH), stdlib
# platform paths come from LOCALAPPDATA/APPDATA, ssl/sockets need SYSTEMROOT,
# and tempfile needs TEMP/TMP. Dropping them breaks collection on native
# Windows (issues #67385, #70813). These are location variables, not
# credentials, so forwarding them keeps the isolation intent intact. Each is
# only forwarded when actually set, so POSIX runs are byte-for-byte unchanged.
#
# USERPROFILE is deliberately excluded from this passthrough: forwarding the
# real one is exactly the isolation hole this loop exists to avoid on native
# Windows, where Path.home() reads it directly. It is overridden below,
# alongside HERMES_TEST_HOME, instead. HOMEDRIVE/HOMEPATH are left pointing
# at the real profile on purpose -- Path.home() only falls back to them when
# USERPROFILE is unset, so once USERPROFILE is overridden they're inert for
# that resolution path, and other tools may still need the real values.

# ── Test-runner knobs (computed before we drop env) ────────────────────────
# The runner's own documented environment knobs must survive the hermetic
# `env -i` below, or they are silent no-ops for anyone invoking this script:
#
#   * HERMES_TEST_WORKERS / PATHS / FILE_TIMEOUT / FILE_RETRIES / SLICE are
#     read by run_tests_parallel.py at argparse-default time — inside the
#     stripped environment.
#   * HERMES_TEST_IMAGE is read by tests/docker/conftest.py to skip its
#     session-scoped `docker build`. CI's docker.yml sets it to the image
#     the build step just loaded; stripping it made every per-file pytest
#     subprocess rebuild the 5GB image from a cold builder cache instead
#     (~4 min per worker per run, and the rebuilt image lacked the
#     HERMES_GIT_SHA build-arg the workflow bakes in).
#
# These are test-infrastructure knobs, not credentials — same class as the
# HERMES_RUN_SLOW_PET_TESTS / HERMES_E2E_BROWSER opt-ins already forwarded.
# Keep this an explicit allowlist (no HERMES_TEST_* glob) so the "no
# credential can leak" property stays auditable at a glance.

# ── Isolated HOME for the test run ─────────────────────────────────────────
# `env -i` below forwards HOME, and that has been the last hole in this
# script's isolation. Tests that reach a real install write into the
# developer's actual home: scripts/install.sh links node/npm/npx into
# "$(get_command_link_dir)", which is "$HOME/.local/bin", and npm caches into
# "$HOME/.npm". Both have been overwritten by test runs in practice.
#
# Point HOME at a stable directory instead. It is deliberately PERSISTENT, not
# a per-run tempdir: a fresh home every run would re-download ~50MB of Node
# each time. It must also not live under /var/tmp, which this host clears on a
# 30-day timer.
#
# Set HERMES_TEST_HOME to override. Setting it to your real $HOME is the
# deliberate opt-out.
#
# NOTE: on native Windows, POSIX HOME isolation alone doesn't cover
# Path.home() -- CPython resolves that from USERPROFILE there. Point
# USERPROFILE at the same isolated directory so a native Windows run gets the
# same protection this HOME override already gives POSIX (stopping writes
# into the real ~/.local/bin, ~/.npm). Only touched when USERPROFILE was
# actually set to begin with, so a POSIX run stays byte-for-byte unchanged.
# Native Windows was not testable where this was written; verification
# belongs on the CI lane's windows_only jobs, not asserted here.

# TMPDIR is forwarded when the caller sets it. run_tests_parallel.py reads it

# test temp tree to a RAM-backed /tmp. Measured peak there: 709MB of a 2.7GB
# tmpfs for one subdirectory of the suite.
#
# Keep any value SHORT. Some tests build AF_UNIX sockets under tmp_path, and
# sun_path is capped at 104/108 bytes; a deep TMPDIR reproduced "AF_UNIX path
# too long" when it was tried as a per-file override. A shallow disk root is
# fine -- verified against tests/tools/test_approved_command_clean_slate.py,
# the file that failure was found in.
