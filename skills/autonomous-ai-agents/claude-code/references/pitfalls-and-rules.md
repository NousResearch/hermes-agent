# Claude Code Pitfalls and Hermes Rules

## Pitfalls & Gotchas

1. **Interactive mode REQUIRES tmux** — Claude Code is a full TUI app. Using `pty=true` alone in Hermes terminal works but tmux gives you `capture-pane` for monitoring and `send-keys` for input, which is essential for orchestration.
2. **`--dangerously-skip-permissions` dialog defaults to "No, exit"** — you must send Down then Enter to accept. Print mode (`-p`) skips this entirely.
3. **`--max-budget-usd` minimum is ~$0.05** — system prompt cache creation alone costs this much. Setting lower will error immediately.
4. **`--max-turns` is print-mode only** — ignored in interactive sessions.
5. **Claude may use `python` instead of `python3`** — on systems without a `python` symlink, Claude's bash commands will fail on first try but it self-corrects.
6. **Session resumption requires same directory** — `--continue` finds the most recent session for the current working directory.
7. **`--json-schema` needs enough `--max-turns`** — Claude must read files before producing structured output, which takes multiple turns.
8. **Trust dialog only appears once per directory** — first-time only, then cached.
9. **Background tmux sessions persist** — always clean up with `tmux kill-session -t <name>` when done.
10. **Slash commands (like `/commit`) only work in interactive mode** — in `-p` mode, describe the task in natural language instead.
11. **`--bare` skips OAuth** — requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env var or an `apiKeyHelper` in settings.
12. **Context degradation is real** — AI output quality measurably degrades above 70% context window usage. Monitor with `/context` and proactively `/compact`.


## Rules for Hermes Agents

1. **Prefer print mode (`-p`) for single tasks** — cleaner, no dialog handling, structured output
2. **Use tmux for multi-turn interactive work** — the only reliable way to orchestrate the TUI
3. **Always set `workdir`** — keep Claude focused on the right project directory
4. **Set `--max-turns` in print mode** — prevents infinite loops and runaway costs
5. **Monitor tmux sessions** — use `tmux capture-pane -t <session> -p -S -50` to check progress
6. **Look for the `❯` prompt** — indicates Claude is waiting for input (done or asking a question)
7. **Clean up tmux sessions** — kill them when done to avoid resource leaks
8. **Report results to user** — after completion, summarize what Claude did and what changed
9. **Don't kill slow sessions** — Claude may be doing multi-step work; check progress instead
10. **Use `--allowedTools`** — restrict capabilities to what the task actually needs
