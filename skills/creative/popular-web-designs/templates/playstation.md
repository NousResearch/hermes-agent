## Overview

PlayStation's marketing system reads like a console launch trailer scrolling past the viewer in chapters. Each section is a full-bleed band — pure black `{colors.canvas-dark}`, true white `{colors.canvas-light}`, or PlayStation Blue `{colors.primary}` — and each chapter owns one editorial moment: hero console photography, a games-coming-soon strip, the PlayStation Plus tier banner, the "30 Years of PlayStation" anniversary band, the news strip from the PlayStation Blog. There is no decorative chrome between chapters; the section background change IS the divider. Sections stack at `{spacing.section}` (96px) rhythm with the next band's color taking over the page edge-to-edge.

The system has two distinct surface modes that alternate down the page: a **dark canvas mode** for editorial product moments (hero, "ON PLAYSTATION" band, marathon game pages) and a **light canvas mode** for utility surfaces (PS5 games listing, support pages, news index). Both modes use the same chrome vocabulary — fully-rounded `{rounded.full}` pill buttons, 8px-radius `{rounded.md}` cards, the proprietary PlayStation SST face — only the surface and on-surface colors change. The third surface mode is the **PlayStation Blue band** (`{colors.primary}` — `#0070d1`) reserved for the highest-priority moments: the Marathon launch CTA strip, the footer, and any "Action Required" banner.

The typography is the system's most distinctive choice. PlayStation SST renders display headlines at **weight 300** (light) — unusual for a gaming brand that could easily reach for bold geometric display faces. The light weight gives the chrome an airy, almost editorial quality that lets the imagery speak; copy is information rather than decoration. Heading sizes drop in tight increments (54 → 44 → 35 → 28 → 22 → 18) and body settles at 18px with 1.5 line-height for comfortable long-form reading on support and games pages.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Three-canvas chapter system: `{colors.canvas-dark}` (black), `{colors.canvas-light}` (white), `{colors.primary}` (PlayStation Blue) alternating down the page
- PlayStation Blue (`{colors.primary}` — `#0070d1`) is the universal primary CTA — fully-rounded pill at `{rounded.full}` (9999px)
- Commerce orange (`{colors.commerce}` — `#d53b00`) is the secondary CTA reserved for "Buy now" / "Pre-order" / store actions
- PlayStation SST display tier renders at **weight 300** with -0.1px to +0.4px tracking — the brand's signature airy editorial voice
- 8px-radius (`{rounded.md}`) for product cards and feature panels; 4px-radius (`{rounded.sm}`) for inputs; pills (`{rounded.full}`) for every CTA
- Game tiles, console renders, and PS Plus tier illustrations occupy 60-90% of each section — imagery does the storytelling
- Color-block page rhythm (one observed band sequence): dark hero → light console showcase → dark "Great PS4 & PS5 games" rail → light "Discover PlayStation Plus" tier band → light "30 years of PlayStation" callout → dark "ON PLAYSTATION" band → light news strip → blue footer

## Colors

> **Source pages:** `/en-tr/` (home), `/en-tr/ps5/games/` (PS5 games listing), `/en-tr/games/marathon/` (single game page), `/tr-tr/support/account/` (support center). The chrome palette is identical across all four pages; the support page uses the light-canvas mode exclusively while marketing pages alternate.

### Brand & Accent
- **PlayStation Blue** (`{colors.primary}` — `#0070d1`): the brand's universal primary. Every primary CTA pill, the active filter chip, the footer surface, badge fills, and inline link color on dark surfaces.
- **PlayStation Blue Pressed** (`{colors.primary-pressed}` — `#0064b7`): pressed state for the primary pill — also doubles as the inline link color on light surfaces.
- **PlayStation Blue Active** (`{colors.primary-active}` — `#004d8d`): deeply-pressed state for the primary button.
- **Commerce Orange** (`{colors.commerce}` — `#d53b00`): the secondary CTA reserved for store/buy/pre-order actions. The only warm color in the system.
- **Commerce Orange Pressed** (`{colors.commerce-pressed}` — `#aa2f00`): pressed state for commerce buttons.
- **Marathon Yellow** (`{colors.marathon-yellow}` — `#deff20`): a single high-saturation game-page accent extracted from Marathon's product palette — used only inside the dedicated `/marathon/` game page chrome and not part of the system's general accent vocabulary.

### Surface
- **Canvas Dark** (`{colors.canvas-dark}` — `#000000`): pure black hero band, primary nav background, footer base. The dominant surface for editorial product moments.
- **Surface Dark Elevated** (`{colors.surface-dark-elevated}` — `#121314`): inset dark panels, PS Plus tier banner background, "ON PLAYSTATION" gradient end.
- **Surface Dark Card** (`{colors.surface-dark-card}` — `#181818`): game tile fill, dark product card background.
- **Canvas Light** (`{colors.canvas-light}` — `#ffffff`): true white console-showcase band, support page body, news strip background.
- **Soft Surface** (`{colors.surface-soft}` — `#f3f3f3`): hairline-soft band fill on light pages, divider rule on light surfaces.
- **Surface Card** (`{colors.surface-card}` — `#f5f7fa`): cool-blue-tinted product card and tier-card background on light canvas.
- **Surface Filter** (`{colors.surface-filter}` — `rgba(245,247,250,0.3)`): translucent fill for filter-pill default state on light canvas.
- **Hairline Light** (`{colors.hairline-light}` — `#f3f3f3`): 1px divider rule on light pages.
- **Hairline Dark** (`{colors.hairline-dark}` — `rgba(229,229,229,0.2)`): translucent 1px divider on dark canvas.

### Text
- **Ink** (`{colors.ink}` — `#000000`): primary text on `{colors.canvas-light}`. Headlines, button text, support body.
- **Ink Deep** (`{colors.ink-deep}` — `#121314`): warmer near-black for in-card titles on dark surfaces and deep-shadow gradients.
- **Ink Elevated** (`{colors.ink-elevated}` — `#181818`): the lightest of the dark-canvas inks, used for elevated card backgrounds.
- **Body Light** (`{colors.body-light}` — `rgba(0,0,0,0.6)`): translucent body text on light canvas — the system's default paragraph color.
- **Mute Light** (`{colors.mute-light}` — `#6b6b6b`): metadata text and footer link captions on light canvas.
- **Ash Light** (`{colors.ash-light}` — `#cccccc`): disabled-state text and lowest-emphasis utility on light surfaces.
- **On Dark** (`{colors.on-dark}` — `#ffffff`): primary text on `{colors.canvas-dark}` — headlines, button text on dark hero bands.
- **Body Dark** (`{colors.body-dark}` — `rgba(255,255,255,0.7)`): translucent body text on dark canvas.
- **On Dark Mute** (`{colors.on-dark-mute}` — `#cccccc`): secondary text and disabled state on dark surfaces.
- **Mute Dark** (`{colors.mute-dark}` — `rgba(229,229,229,0.55)`): captions and metadata on dark canvas.

### Semantic
- **Warning** (`{colors.warning}` — `#c81b3a`): validation errors and destructive confirmation copy.
- **Link Light** (`{colors.link-light}` — `#0064b7`): inline body-prose anchor link on light canvas — same hex as `{colors.primary-pressed}`.
- **Link Dark** (`{colors.link-dark}` — `#53b1ff`): inline body-prose anchor link on dark canvas — a brightened blue for dark-mode legibility.

### Brand Gradient
- **PlayStation Plus Gold Gradient** — a horizontal three-stop gold gradient `{colors.ps-plus-gold-start}` (`#ffce21`) → `{colors.ps-plus-gold-mid}` (`#f5a623`) → `{colors.ps-plus-gold-end}` (`#ee8e00`) that anchors the PS Plus banner on the home page. The only gradient in the system; reserved exclusively for PS Plus chrome.

## Typography

### Font Family
- **PlayStation SST** is the proprietary brand sans-serif used across every text role on the site. It carries weights 300 (light), 400 (regular), 500 (medium), 600 (semibold), and 700 (bold), and falls back through `sst` → `Arial` → `Helvetica`. The brand's distinctive choice is using **weight 300 (light) for display headlines** — unusual for a gaming brand and the source of the system's editorial, airy character.
- **SST** appears as a secondary cut for in-product surfaces, falling back to Helvetica → Arial.

### Hierarchy

| Token | Size | Weight | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `{typography.display-xl}` | 54px | 300 | 1.25 | -0.1px | Hero headline ("Discover all PS5 consoles and accessories") |
| `{typography.display-lg}` | 44px | 300 | 1.25 | 0.1px | Section headline ("Great PS4 & PS5 games out now or coming soon") |
| `{typography.display-md}` | 35px | 300 | 1.25 | 0 | Mid-section headline, game-page sub-hero |
| `{typography.heading-xl}` | 28px | 300 | 1.25 | 0.1px | "30 Years of PlayStation" callout, in-band sub-heading |
| `{typography.heading-lg}` | 22px | 300 | 1.25 | 0.1px | News card title, support category title |
| `{typography.heading-md}` | 18px | 600 | 1 | 0 | Card label, navigation menu heading, in-product strong title |
| `{typography.body-md}` | 18px | 400 | 1.5 | 0.1px | Body copy, paragraph text, support article body |
| `{typography.body-strong}` | 18px | 500 | 1.25 | 0.4px | Inline emphasis, primary nav link, button label (large) |
| `{typography.body-sm}` | 16px | 400 | 1.5 | 0 | Card description, secondary body |
| `{typography.caption-md}` | 14px | 400 | 1.5 | 0 | Footer link, metadata, sub-nav text |
| `{typography.caption-sm}` | 12px | 500 | 1.5 | 0 | Smallest utility text, badge label |
| `{typography.link-md}` | 18px | 400 | 1.5 | 0 | Inline body-prose anchor link |
| `{typography.button-lg}` | 18px | 700 | 1.25 | 0.45px | Primary CTA pill |
| `{typography.button-md}` | 14px | 700 | 1.25 | 0.324px | Compact pill, filter chip, secondary CTA |

### Principles
The hierarchy works on a 1.25-line-height ladder almost exclusively — even body sits at 1.5 instead of the typical 1.6 — which keeps long-form support pages tight and console showcases efficient. The weight contrast between display (300) and button (700) is dramatic: a single 18px chrome line might host a heavyweight CTA next to a feather-light 22px headline, giving the system its editorial gaming-magazine feel.

### Note on Font Substitutes
PlayStation SST is proprietary. The closest open-source substitutes:
- **Roboto Light (300)** for the display tier — its slightly looser letter-spacing matches SST's display optical fit.
- **Inter** at weights 400/500/600 for body and chrome — the closest geometric sans match for SST's body cut.
- **Source Sans Pro Light (300)** as an alternative for the display tier when Roboto reads too utilitarian.

When substituting, preserve the +0.1px to +0.45px tracking on display and button tiers — the spacing is part of what makes PlayStation SST feel premium at the light weight.

## Layout

### Spacing System
- **Base unit:** 8px (with finer 4/12px steps for tight inline gaps).
- **Tokens (front matter):** `{spacing.xxs}` (4px) · `{spacing.xs}` (8px) · `{spacing.sm}` (12px) · `{spacing.md}` (16px) · `{spacing.lg}` (24px) · `{spacing.xl}` (32px) · `{spacing.xxl}` (48px) · `{spacing.section}` (96px).
- **Universal section rhythm:** every page in the set uses `{spacing.section}` (96px) as the vertical gap between major content blocks. Card grids use `{spacing.lg}` (24px) gutters; in-card padding sits at `{spacing.lg}` to `{spacing.xl}` depending on density.
- **Hero band padding:** 96px vertical / 48px horizontal — the largest spacing in the system, reserved for full-bleed surface chapters.

### Grid & Container
- **Max width:** ~1280px content area for body text on desktop with 24px gutters that expand to ~48px at ultrawide. Hero bands and game-tile rails go full-bleed with no max-width constraint on imagery.
- **Game tile carousel:** 4-up at desktop with horizontal scroll on the same row, collapsing to 3-up at 1024px and 2-up at 768px. Each tile uses 16:9 cover art at `{rounded.md}`.
- **Console showcase grid:** desktop 5-column thumbnail strip below the main hero render, collapsing to 3-up + horizontal scroll at tablet.
- **Support page:** desktop 2-column 30/70 split (sidebar nav + article body), collapsing to single-column with the sidebar promoted to a top accordion at mobile.
- **News strip:** 3-up card grid at desktop, 2-up at tablet, 1-up at mobile.

### Whitespace Philosophy
Whitespace is structural and band-defined. The 96px `{spacing.section}` between chapters reads as silence between trailer cuts — there's no decorative wash, no gradient transition, no mid-section divider. Inside a section, content is left-aligned in a tight column with the imagery breathing in the right 60-70% of the band. Paragraph text is comfortable at 1.5 line-height but column widths stay narrow (~520px at desktop) to keep long-form copy readable.

## Elevation & Depth

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|---|---|---|
| 0 — Flat | No border, no shadow | Default for hero bands, footer, full-bleed sections — the dominant treatment |
| 1 — Hairline divider | 1px solid `{colors.hairline-light}` or `{colors.hairline-dark}` | Card borders, support row dividers, footer column rules |
| 2 — Soft active shadow | `0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.16)` | Active/pressed CTAs, lifted product card |
| 3 — Section gradient | Soft top-to-bottom darkening from `{colors.surface-dark-elevated}` to `{colors.canvas-dark}` | "ON PLAYSTATION" band — only place a gradient appears on chrome |

The system has effectively no resting shadow on cards; depth is built from surface-color contrast across band chapters. Cards lift only on press.

### Decorative Depth
Depth comes from the alternating-band rhythm and from the imagery itself:
- **Console product photography** — DualSense controller and PS5 console renders shot on neutral white with crisp edge lighting, full-bleed inside the light-canvas band.
- **Game key art** — full-bleed cinematic stills (Marathon, the latest blockbuster releases) inside dark-canvas bands with title lockup overlaid in the lower-left.
- **PS Plus tier banner** — a subtle horizontal gold gradient (`{colors.ps-plus-gold-start}` → `{colors.ps-plus-gold-end}`) sits as the only chrome gradient in the system, anchoring the "Discover PlayStation Plus" CTA.
- **"ON PLAYSTATION" gradient band** — top-to-bottom deepening from `{colors.surface-dark-elevated}` (`#121314`) to `{colors.canvas-dark}` (`#000000`) creates a cinematic dimming effect under the anniversary callout.

## Shapes

### Border Radius Scale

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `{rounded.none}` | 0px | Hero bands, primary nav, footer, sub-nav, support article body — every full-bleed structural surface |
| `{rounded.sm}` | 4px | Text inputs, support search field utilities |
| `{rounded.md}` | 8px | Game tiles, product cards, feature cards, PS Plus banner |
| `{rounded.lg}` | 16px | Rare large container with extra-soft corners (e.g., dialog cards) |
| `{rounded.full}` | 9999px | Every CTA pill (primary / commerce / secondary), filter chips, pagination dots, carousel paddles |

The radius vocabulary works on a 4 / 8 / pill rhythm for chrome with structural surfaces staying flat at 0px.

### Photography Geometry
- **Hero console render:** large centered console + DualSense composition on white, ~70% width of the band, with copy slot to the left.
- **Game tiles:** 16:9 key art at `{rounded.md}` (8px), 4-up rail at desktop with horizontal carousel.
- **Marathon game page hero:** full-bleed cinematic 16:9 still with the "MARATHON" wordmark in the lower-left at light weight, brand yellow `{colors.marathon-yellow}` accent on a few small UI tags.
- **News card thumbnails:** 16:9 imagery at `{rounded.md}` with a small text block below.
- **Avatar / brand icons:** 32–40px circles for sub-nav social row.

### Inputs & Forms

**`text-input`** + **`text-input-focused`**
- Default: background `{colors.canvas-light}`, text `{colors.ink}`, 1px solid `{colors.ash-light}`, type `{typography.body-md}`, padding `12px 16px`, height ~48px, rounded `{rounded.sm}` (4px).

- Used for FAQ / category-listing rows on the support page with a small chevron-right icon at the right edge.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Reserve `{colors.primary}` (PlayStation Blue) for primary CTAs and the footer surface only. The blue band is precious — at most one full-bleed blue band per page.
- Reserve `{colors.commerce}` (orange) for store/buy/pre-order CTAs only. It is never used on marketing chrome or hero pills.
- Use PlayStation SST at weight 300 for display headings (54 / 44 / 35 / 28 / 22). The light weight is the brand voice.
- Stack content sections at `{spacing.section}` (96px) rhythm with the next band's surface color taking over the page edge-to-edge — no decorative dividers between bands.
- Use `{rounded.full}` (9999px) on every CTA pill and `{rounded.md}` (8px) on every product card. The two-radius vocabulary is the entire shape system aside from inputs.
- Pair full-bleed game key art and console renders inside dark or light bands; let imagery occupy 60-90% of the band's vertical height.
- Use `{component.ps-plus-banner}` with the gold gradient exclusively for the PlayStation Plus tier callout — never decorate other components with the gold.

### Don't
- Don't introduce drop shadows on resting cards. The system is flat-on-canvas; cards lift only on press.
- Don't replace `{colors.primary}` with another shade of blue. The brand blue is precise — `#0070d1` for default and `#0064b7` for pressed.
- Don't use `{colors.commerce}` (orange) on marketing/hero CTAs. It's reserved exclusively for store actions.
- Don't introduce a sans-serif body font, italic, or monospace style. PlayStation SST carries every text role.
- Don't soften pill geometry. CTAs are always `{rounded.full}` — no medium-radius buttons.
- Don't use the gold PS Plus gradient on anything that isn't the PS Plus banner. It is a tier-specific brand asset.
- Don't put a gradient on chrome. The only allowed gradient is the gold PS Plus accent and the soft top-to-bottom darkening of the "ON PLAYSTATION" band.

## Responsive Behavior

### Breakpoints

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| ultrawide | 1920px+ | Hero band stays at content max-width 1280px; outer gutters grow to ~80px |
| desktop-large | 1440px | Default desktop — 4-up game tile carousel, full primary nav |
| desktop | 1280px | Same layout with narrower outer gutters |
| desktop-small | 1024px | Game tile rail collapses to 3-up; sub-nav remains horizontal |
| tablet | 768px | Game tiles → 2-up; primary nav becomes hamburger drawer |
| mobile | 480px | Single-column everything; hero `{typography.display-xl}` scales 54px → ~32px |
| mobile-narrow | 320px | Section padding tightens to 32px; hero further scales to ~28px |

### Touch Targets
All interactive elements meet WCAG AAA (≥ 44×44px). `{component.button-primary}` and `{component.button-commerce}` sit at 48px height with 28px horizontal padding (effective ~48×100px tappable). `{component.text-input}` sits at 48px. `{component.support-search-bar}` sits at 56px. `{component.filter-pill}` is ~36–40px height with 16px padding extending to 44px tappable via inline padding. `{component.carousel-paddle}` is exactly 48×48 circular.

### Collapsing Strategy
- **Primary nav:** desktop horizontal cluster → tablet hamburger drawer at 768px. The right-cluster icons (search, cart, account) stay visible at every breakpoint.
- **Sub-nav:** desktop horizontal anchor row → tablet horizontal scroll → mobile select dropdown.
- **Game tile carousel:** 4-up → 3-up → 2-up at 1024 and 768px; carousel paddles stay visible at every desktop breakpoint, hide on mobile in favor of touch-swipe.
- **Hero bands:** stay full-bleed at every breakpoint; only the internal content column reflows from 2-column (text-left + image-right) to single-column (text above image).
- **Console showcase:** desktop 5-up thumbnail strip → tablet 3-up + horizontal scroll → mobile 1-up with paddle.
- **Support page:** desktop 30/70 split (sidebar + body) → tablet sidebar promoted to top accordion → mobile fully collapsed accordion.
- **Section padding:** `{spacing.section}` (96px) desktop → 64px tablet → 48px mobile.
- **Hero headline:** `{typography.display-xl}` (54px) at desktop, scaling 44px / 32px / 28px down the breakpoint stack.

### Image Behavior
- Hero imagery (console renders, game key art) uses art-direction crops on mobile so the central subject stays centered when the band collapses to single-column.
- Game tile cover art preserves 16:9 ratio at every breakpoint; only the column count changes.
- Console showcase thumbnails maintain their natural aspect (~1:1 product render) across breakpoints.
- All non-critical imagery is lazy-loaded as the user scrolls into the next chapter.

## Iteration Guide

1. Focus on ONE component at a time. Pull its YAML entry and verify every property resolves.
2. Reference component names and tokens directly (`{colors.primary}`, `{component.button-primary-pressed}`, `{rounded.full}`) — do not paraphrase.
3. Run `npx @google/design.md lint DESIGN.md` after edits — `broken-ref`, `contrast-ratio`, and `orphaned-tokens` warnings flag issues automatically.
4. Add new variants as separate component entries (`-pressed`, `-disabled`) — do not bury them inside prose.
5. Default body to `{typography.body-md}` (18px / 400 / 1.5); reach for `{typography.display-xl}` strictly for the page-top hero headline; use `{typography.body-strong}` for primary nav links.
6. Keep `{colors.primary}` scarce per viewport — at most one full-bleed PlayStation Blue band per page.
7. When introducing a new component, ask whether it can be expressed with the existing pill + 8px-radius card + full-bleed-band vocabulary before adding new tokens. The system's strength is that it almost never needs new ones.

## Known Gaps

- **Mobile screenshots not captured** — responsive behavior synthesizes PlayStation's known mobile pattern (hamburger drawer, single-column band reflow, hero downscale) from desktop evidence and the breakpoint stack.
- **Hover states not documented** by system policy.
- **Sign-in / authentication chrome** (login modal, account dashboard, profile pages) not in the captured pages.
- **PlayStation Store** in-store browsing surfaces (PDP / cart / checkout) are not in the captured set — those use a more dense data-table layout that this document does not describe.
- **Game-page-specific theming** — the `/marathon/` page uses `{colors.marathon-yellow}` as a chapter accent. Other game pages may pull in their own per-title brand colors that vary outside the documented system.
- **Form validation states** (success / error inline messages) not present in the captured surfaces beyond the `{colors.warning}` color token.
