## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere

Starbucks' design system is a **warm, confident retail flagship** wearing the green of their storefront apron across every surface. The canvas alternates between a neutral-warm cream (`#f2f0eb`) and a ceramic off-white (`#edebe9`) — colors that reference actual store materials: the paper napkins, the café walls, the wood finishes — while the signature **Starbucks Green** (`#006241`) anchors the brand moment on hero bands, CTAs, and the Rewards experience. The greens come in four calibrated shades (Starbucks, Accent, House, Uplift) each mapped to a specific surface role, and gold (`#cba258`) appears only around Rewards-status ceremony — not as a general accent.

Typography carries most of the brand voice. The proprietary **SoDoSans** typeface (custom to Starbucks) sits across nearly every surface with a tight `-0.16px` letter-spacing — it reads confident and friendly rather than fashion-magazine severe. What's unusual: the Rewards page switches to a warm serif (`"Lander Tall", "Iowan Old Style", Georgia`) for specific headline moments, subtly echoing the nostalgic feel of a coffeehouse chalkboard. And the Careers pages use a handwritten script (`"Kalam", "Comic Sans MS", cursive`) for personal cup-name touches. Three typefaces, three contexts — the system is disciplined about when each appears.

The surfaces breathe through rounded geometry. Every button is a 50px full-pill. Cards take a 12px rounded-rectangle. The "Frap" floating CTA — a 56px circular order button in Green Accent (`#00754A`) — is the product's signature depth move: it floats bottom-right with a layered shadow stack (`0 0 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.24)` base + `0 8px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.14)` ambient) and compresses via `scale(0.95)` on press. Elevations are otherwise restrained — card shadows stay at a whispered `0.14/0.24` alpha, global nav gets a quiet three-layer shadow stack. The whole system feels like clean café signage: legible, warm, and never shouting.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Four-tier green brand system (Starbucks / Accent / House / Uplift) each mapped to a distinct surface role — not a single "brand green"
- Gold reserved for Rewards-status moments only; never a general-purpose accent
- Warm-neutral canvas (`#f2f0eb` / `#edebe9`) instead of cold white — references café materials
- Custom proprietary typeface (SoDoSans) with tight `-0.16px` letter-spacing as the universal voice
- Context-specific type switches: serif (Lander Tall) for Rewards, script (Kalam) for Careers cup-names
- Full-pill buttons (`50px` radius) universal, `scale(0.95)` active press the signature micro-interaction
- Floating "Frap" circular CTA (`56px`, Green Accent fill, layered shadow stack) — the product's signature elevation element
- Gift-card surfaces designed as **photographed physical product** — every card is a distinct illustrated photograph rather than a generated graphic
- 12px card radius + whisper-soft shadows keep content cards flat-plus-hint-of-lift
- Rem-based spacing scale anchored at 1.6rem (~16px) = `--space-3`, stepping to 6.4rem (~64px)

**Color-block page rhythm:** Cream hero → White content sections → Dark-green (`#1E3932`) feature band with white text → Cream utility zone → Dark-green (`#1E3932`) footer with gold / white text — an espresso-dark bookend around the bright body.

## 2. Color Palette & Roles

**Source pages analyzed:** homepage, rewards, gift cards, product detail (Pink Energy Drink), product nutrition (Cold Brew).

### Primary

- **Starbucks Green** (`#006241`): The historic brand green. Used on h1 headings, primary section headers on the Rewards page, and as the main brand signal wherever a single dominant color is needed.
- **Green Accent** (`#00754A`): A slightly brighter, more luminous green. The primary filled-CTA color ("Explore our afternoon menu", "See the spring menu") and the fill of the floating Frap circular button.
- **House Green** (`#1E3932`): The deep near-black brand green. Footer surface, feature-band backgrounds, reward-status dark surfaces, and the headline "Free coffee is just the beginning" hero band on Rewards.
- **Green Uplift** (`#2b5148`): A secondary mid-dark green used sparingly on decorative accents and dark-gradient moments.
- **Green Light** (`#d4e9e2`): A pale mint wash used for form-valid-state tints and light green utility surfaces.

### Secondary & Accent

- **Gold** (`#cba258`): Reserved almost exclusively for Rewards-status ceremony — Gold-tier callouts, partnership badges (SkyMiles, Bonvoy), and premium-feeling accents. Never a general-purpose brand color.
- **Gold Light** (`#dfc49d`): Softer gold for background washes on gold-tier sections.
- **Gold Lightest** (`#faf6ee`): Cream-gold page-surface wash used under partnership sections on the Rewards page — ties the gold accent back into the warm neutral system.

### Surface & Background

- **White** (`#ffffff`): Primary card and modal surface. Also card fill on gift-card tiles.
- **Neutral Cool** (`#f9f9f9`): Subtle cool-gray surface used on dropdown menus ("Account" dropdown), form-card wraps, and quiet utility containers.
- **Neutral Warm** (`#f2f0eb`): The warm cream **primary page canvas** for Rewards utility zones and hero bands.
- **Ceramic** (`#edebe9`): A slightly warmer/darker cream for zone separators, soft page-section washes, and Rewards partnership band.
- **Black** (`#000000`): Deep ink reserved for the dark top-of-page CTA strip ("Join now") and high-contrast top-nav sign-in buttons.

### Neutrals & Text

- **Text Black** (`rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87)`): Primary heading and body text color on light surfaces. Not pure black — an 87%-opacity black that reads warmer.
- **Text Black Soft** (`rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.58)`): Secondary/metadata text on light surfaces.
- **Text White** (`rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)`): Primary heading/body text on dark green surfaces.
- **Text White Soft** (`rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.70)`): Secondary text on dark-green surfaces — footer link descriptions, caption text.
- **Rewards Green** (`#33433d`): A dedicated muted slate-green used only on Rewards-page text blocks — a slightly "dustier" reading color than Text Black that signals "reward surface" without using full Starbucks Green.

### Semantic & Accent

- **Red** (`#c82014`): Error and destructive state (form invalid, destructive actions).
- **Yellow** (`#fbbc05`): Warning state, legacy brand touch.
- **Green Light** (`#d4e9e2` at 33% opacity = `hsl(160 32% 87% / 33%)`): Form valid-field tint background.
- **Red Tint** (`hsl(4 82% 43% / 5%)`): Invalid-field tint on forms.

### Black / White Alpha Ladders

Two parallel translucent scales for overlay and secondary-text use:
- `rgba(0,0,0,0.06)` through `rgba(0,0,0,0.90)` in 10% steps — for dark overlays on light surfaces
- `rgba(255,255,255,0.10)` through `rgba(255,255,255,0.90)` in 10% steps — for light overlays on dark surfaces

### Gradient System

No structural gradient tokens observed. Surface hierarchy is solid-color-block throughout — the system relies on its five-tier cream/green surface palette rather than gradients.

## 3. Typography Rules

### Font Family

- **Primary:** `SoDoSans, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif` — Starbucks' proprietary corporate typeface, used across nearly every surface
- **Loading Fallback:** `"Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif` — what users see before SoDoSans loads
- **Rewards Serif:** `"Lander Tall", "Iowan Old Style", Georgia, serif` — used on specific Rewards-page headline moments for a warm editorial feel
- **Careers Script:** `"Kalam", "Comic Sans MS", cursive` — used exclusively for Careers-page "cup name" decorative touches, referencing the hand-written names on Starbucks cups

No OpenType stylistic sets explicitly activated at `:root`.

### Hierarchy

| Role | Size | Weight | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Notes |
|------|------|--------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| Display (text-10) | 5.0rem / 80px | 400–600 | 1.2 | -0.16px | Largest Rewards/hero display |
| Jumbo (text-9) | 3.6rem / 58px | 400–600 | 1.2 | -0.16px | Secondary hero headings |
| Hero Large (text-8) | 2.8rem / 45px | 400–600 | 1.2–1.5 | -0.16px | Landing section headlines |
| H1 | 24px | 600 | 36px | -0.16px | Starbucks-Green primary heading |
| H2 | 24px | 400 | 36px | -0.16px | Regular-weight section title in Text Black |
| Body Large | 19px | 400–600 | 33.25px (~1.75) | -0.16px | Hero intro copy, feature-band body |
| Body (text-3) | 1.6rem / 16px | 400 | 1.5 (24px) | -0.01em | Default body copy |
| Small (text-2) | 1.4rem / ~14px | 400–600 | 1.5 | -0.01em | Button label, metadata, form labels |
| Micro (text-1) | 1.3rem / ~13px | 400 | 1.5 | -0.01em | Active float-label state, caption micro-copy |
| Button Label | 14–16px | 400–600 | 1.2 | -0.01em | All pill-button labels |

**Letter-spacing tokens:**
- `letterSpacingNormal`: `-0.01em` (default — tight, characteristic)
- `letterSpacingLoose`: `0.1em` (emphasized caps)
- `letterSpacingLooser`: `0.15em` (uppercase-style labels, extreme emphasis)

**Line-height tokens:**
- `lineHeightNormal`: `1.5` (body)
- `lineHeightCompact`: `1.2` (display/buttons)

### Principles

- **Tight negative tracking (`-0.01em`)** is applied almost universally — the entire product reads slightly compressed, which gives SoDoSans its confident presence without feeling squeezed.
- **Weight shifts carry hierarchy, not size shifts.** H1 and H2 share the same 24px/36px size; only weight (600 vs 400) and color (Starbucks-Green vs Text Black) separate them.
- **Size tokens use rem, anchored to `1rem = 10px`** on this site (via a `font-size: 62.5%` root trick). So `1.6rem` = 16px, `2.4rem` = 24px, etc. The scale is semantic (textSize-1 through textSize-10), not arbitrary pixel values.
- **Context-specific typeface swaps** — serif on Rewards, script on Careers — are deliberate and localized. Never mix them with the primary sans within the same surface.
- **Body text never goes pure black** — it sits at `rgba(0,0,0,0.87)` to match the warm-neutral canvas temperature.

### Note on Font Substitutes

SoDoSans is proprietary to Starbucks (licensed from House Industries, not publicly available). Reasonable open-source substitutes:
- **Inter** (Google Fonts) — similar humanist geometric proportions, wide weight range
- **Manrope** — slightly rounder, similar confident feel
- **Nunito Sans** — warmer, good for a "café" brand substitute

If substituting, verify the tight `-0.01em` / `-0.16px` tracking still reads well; some open-source fonts need `-0.005em` instead.

Lander Tall (the Rewards serif) is custom — open-source substitutes: **Iowan Old Style** (already in fallback), **Lora**, or **Source Serif Pro**. Kalam (Careers script) is available on Google Fonts directly.

- Transition: `0.3s option-label-marker-expansion cubic-bezier(0.32, 2.32, 0.61, 0.27)` on checked-input

**Option Icon (checkbox/radio)**
- Padding: `3px` inner
- Uses the checked-input cubic-bezier animation above (a slightly "springy" 2.32 overshoot curve)

### Navigation

**Global Nav (top bar)**
- Fixed position with progressive heights: `64px` xs → `72px` mobile → `83px` tablet → `99px` desktop
- Shadow stack: `0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1), 0 2px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.06), 0 0 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.07)` — three-layer soft lift
- Left: Starbucks wordmark logo, offsetting by `99px` (md) / `131px` (lg) from left edge
- Primary links inline in SoDoSans weight 400–600: Menu · Rewards · Gift Cards
- Right: Find a store link + Sign in (outlined) + Join now (black filled)

**Sub-nav (second bar, e.g., Rewards internal)**
- Height: `53px` (global subnav) / `48px` (internal subnav)
- Typically horizontal tab group beneath the global nav

**Mobile Nav**
- Collapses to a hamburger drawer below tablet breakpoint
- Frap floating button persists at bottom-right regardless of nav state

### Image Treatment

- **Hero photography**: Product photos (beverages in clear glass with colored backgrounds — coral, sage, warm amber) occupy ~40vw of a split-hero layout; text occupies the other 60vw (`--headerCrateProportion: 40vw` / `--contentCrateProportion: 60vw`)
- **Gift card illustrations**: Each card is a distinct illustrated photograph (painted-feel, hand-drawn-looking, warm color palette). Never generic generated graphics.
- **Rewards ceremony imagery**: Photographs of Starbucks Rewards App screens held in-hand, angled compositions — product-in-context photography.
- **Menu thumbnails**: Square or 4:3 product photography with clean white/cream backdrops, slight soft drop-shadow around the glass.
- **Image fade-in**: `opacity 0.3s ease-in` transition on image load (`--imageFadeTransition`).

### Feature Band (dark-green hero strip)

Full-width `#1E3932` (House Green) band with:
- Left: white headline + subhead + CTA row
- Right: product photography or illustration
- Split ratio ~40/60 or 50/50 depending on section
- White text throughout with `rgba(255,255,255,0.70)` for secondary copy
- CTAs follow Green-on-Green Inverted (white filled) + Outlined on Dark (white outline) pairing

### Expander / Accordion

- Duration: `300ms` (`--expanderDuration`)
- Timing curve: `cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.46, 0.45, 0.94)` — a measured ease-out

## 5. Layout Principles

### Spacing System

Rem-based semantic scale (anchored `1rem = 10px`):

| Token | Rem | Pixels | Typical Use |
|-------|-----|--------|-------------|
| `--space-1` | `0.4rem` | 4px | Tightest inline padding |
| `--space-2` | `0.8rem` | 8px | Small gap, button vertical padding |
| `--space-3` | `1.6rem` | 16px | Default — card padding, outer gutter xs |
| `--space-4` | `2.4rem` | 24px | Section inner spacing, outer gutter md |
| `--space-5` | `3.2rem` | 32px | Major between-section spacing |
| `--space-6` | `4rem` | 40px | Large gaps, outer gutter lg, header crate |
| `--space-7` | `4.8rem` | 48px | Section-to-section spacing |
| `--space-8` | `5.6rem` | 56px | Very large breathing — Frap height |
| `--space-9` | `6.4rem` | 64px | Widest section padding |

**Gutter tokens:**
- `--outerGutter: 1.6rem` (16px, default / mobile)
- `--outerGutterMedium: 2.4rem` (24px, tablet)
- `--outerGutterLarge: 4.0rem` (40px, desktop)

**Universal rhythm constant:** `1.6rem` (16px) appears across every page as the default outer gutter, card padding baseline, and text size 3 body — the system's most frequent spacing unit.

### Grid & Container

- Column width scale: `--columnWidthSmall: 343px` / `Medium: 500px` / `Large: 720px` / `XLarge: 1440px`
- Gift-card grid uses a 3-5-up responsive grid of `~343px` tiles
- Rewards status section: 3-up dark-green panels at `lg+` breakpoints
- Hero: asymmetric split 40% (image) / 60% (content) via `--headerCrateProportion` / `--contentCrateProportion`

### Whitespace Philosophy

Whitespace carries the feeling of "plenty of space in the café." Section padding leans generous (40–64px). Content blocks are separated by whitespace rather than dividers. The cream canvas (`#f2f0eb`) is itself a visual breath between white cards and green feature bands.

### Border Radius Scale

| Value | Use |
|-------|-----|
| `12px` | Cards, modals, menu-item tiles (`--cardBorderRadius`) |
| `12px 12px 0 0` | Full-width feedback tab (top-rounded only) |
| `50px` | All buttons — full-pill radius (`--buttonBorderRadius`) |
| `50%` | Circular icons, Frap floating button, avatar thumbnails |
| Specialty | `3.3333%/5.298%` elliptical for Starbucks-Visa-Card mockups (`--svcRoundedCorners`) |

## 6. Depth & Elevation

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Card | `0 0 0.5px rgba(0,0,0,0.14), 0 1px 1px rgba(0,0,0,0.24)` | Default content cards — a whisper-soft dual-shadow |
| Global Nav | `0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1), 0 2px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.06), 0 0 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.07)` | Triple-layer soft lift on the fixed top bar |
| Frap Base | `0 0 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.24)` | Base halo around the floating circular CTA |
| Frap Ambient | `0 8px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.14)` | Stacked directional ambient — floats the Frap forward |
| Gift Card | Light drop shadow around illustrated photograph | Physical-card feel for gift tiles |
| Starbucks Card (SVC) | `drop-shadow(0 4px 1px rgba(0,0,0,0.11)) drop-shadow(0 0 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.24))` | Stacked SVG drop shadows for Starbucks Card visuals |

**Shadow philosophy:** Whisper-soft, layered over solid — the system never reaches for a single heavy drop shadow. Instead, it stacks 2–3 low-alpha shadows with different offsets to simulate real-world ambient + direct lighting. The Frap button is the most elevated element on any page.

### Decorative Depth

- **No gradient system** — surfaces are solid color-block
- **Color-block banding** carries perceived depth (dark-green bands read as "recessed feature zones" between cream/white body sections)
- **SVG filter shadows** on Starbucks-Card visuals add a slight 3D physicality without a box-shadow

## 7. Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use Neutral Warm (`#f2f0eb`) or Ceramic (`#edebe9`) as page canvas instead of pure white — the warm cream is the signature
- Map the green tiers to their intended surface role — Starbucks Green for headings, Green Accent for CTAs, House Green for deep bands, Uplift for decorative
- Keep tracking tight at `-0.01em` / `-0.16px` on SoDoSans across the whole system
- Use 50px full-pill radius on every button without exception
- Apply `transform: scale(0.95)` as the universal button active state
- Reserve Gold for Rewards-status ceremony moments only
- Use SoDoSans for nearly everything; switch to Lander Tall serif only for Rewards editorial headlines; reserve Kalam script for Careers "cup name" moments
- Layer 2–3 low-alpha shadows instead of one heavier drop shadow for elevation
- Use the Frap circular CTA as the persistent floating order entry on every shopping surface
- Let the cream canvas breathe between content cards — use whitespace, not dividers

### Don't
- Don't use pure white as the page canvas — the warm cream temperature is load-bearing
- Don't pick "one brand green" — the four-green system is intentional; using only `#006241` everywhere flattens the brand
- Don't use Gold as a general-purpose accent — it's a Rewards signal only
- Don't square the corners on buttons — the 50px pill is universal
- Don't introduce gradient fills — the system is color-block throughout
- Don't weight-contrast h1 and h2 by size — the hierarchy comes from weight + color (600 Starbucks-Green vs 400 Text Black)
- Don't use pure black for body text — `rgba(0,0,0,0.87)` matches the warm canvas
- Don't skip the `scale(0.95)` active feedback on buttons — it's a signature micro-interaction
- Don't stack single heavy shadows; always layer 2–3 low-alpha ones
- Don't introduce serifs or scripts into the main shopping flow — they belong to Rewards and Careers contexts respectively

## 8. Responsive Behavior

### Breakpoints

Inferred from component width tokens and progressive nav heights:

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|------|-------|-------------|
| xs | < 480px | Global nav 64px; hamburger menu; single-column layouts; pill buttons full-width |
| Mobile | 480–767px | Global nav 72px; gift-card grid 2-up; card padding tightens |
| Tablet | 768–1023px | Global nav 83px; gift-card grid 3-up; hero split begins to appear |
| Desktop | 1024–1439px | Global nav 99px; gift-card grid 4-up; full asymmetric hero 40/60 |
| XLarge | 1440px+ | Content caps at `--columnWidthXLarge`; gift-card grid 5-up; extra cream margin |

### Touch Targets

- Pill buttons at `7px 16px` padding measure ~32px tall — below 44px WCAG AAA minimum for touch-only surfaces. On mobile, button padding may be visually expanded to meet the minimum.
- Frap floating circular button at `56px` is well above minimum.
- Frap uses `--frapTouchOffset: calc(-1 * .8rem)` to extend tap area 8px beyond visual edge.
- Form float-label inputs grow their label font size on mobile (1.6rem base vs 1.9rem desktop) — easier to tap and read at arm's-length.

### Collapsing Strategy

- **Global nav height scales progressively**: 64 → 72 → 83 → 99px across breakpoints, not a single value
- **Hero split collapses**: 40/60 asymmetric split → stacked (image top, content below) at mobile
- **Gift-card grid**: 5-up → 4-up → 3-up → 2-up → 1-up across breakpoints with adjusted card widths
- **Feature bands**: Stay full-width but text + imagery stack vertically on mobile
- **Outer gutter scales**: 16px → 24px → 40px as viewport grows
- **Rewards 3-column status panels**: Stack to single column on mobile

### Image Behavior

- Hero product photography crops tighter vertically on mobile; content becomes the visual anchor
- Gift-card illustrations preserve aspect ratio; card grid reflows
- `opacity 0.3s ease-in` fade-in transition on image load (prevents jarring pop-in)
- Rewards app-in-hand photography scales proportionally; never stretches

### Example Component Prompts

1. "Create a primary Starbucks CTA pill button with Green Accent (`#00754A`) background, white text 'Explore our afternoon menu', SoDoSans font at 16px weight 600 with `-0.01em` letter-spacing, `50px` border-radius (full pill), `7px 16px` padding. Apply `transform: scale(0.95)` as the active state with a `0.2s ease` transition."

2. "Design a content card with White (`#ffffff`) background at `12px` border-radius, layered shadow `0 0 0.5px rgba(0,0,0,0.14), 0 1px 1px rgba(0,0,0,0.24)`. Pad contents `16–24px` (`--space-3` to `--space-4`). Place on a Neutral Warm (`#f2f0eb`) page canvas with `16px` gap to siblings."

3. "Build the Frap floating circular order button — `56px` diameter, Green Accent (`#00754A`) fill, white shopping-bag icon centered. Layered shadow: `0 0 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.24)` + `0 8px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.14)`. Fixed position bottom-right with `-0.8rem` touch offset. Active state collapses the ambient shadow to `0 8px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0)` with `scale(0.95)`."

4. "Build a dark-green feature band — full-width section with House Green (`#1E3932`) background. Left column: white SoDoSans h2 at 24px weight 600, followed by a Text White Soft (`rgba(255,255,255,0.70)`) body paragraph and a CTA row with two buttons (White-filled with Green Accent text for primary, Outlined-on-Dark white border for secondary). Right column: product photography. Split ratio 40/60, stacked vertically below `768px`."

5. "Create a Rewards status card — House Green (`#1E3932`) panel with `12px` border-radius, colored gradient top stripe (Bronze/Silver/Gold tier). Title in SoDoSans 24px weight 600 in white. Benefits list as white bullets with `rgba(255,255,255,0.70)` secondary captions. Bottom progression text in Text White Soft. Stack 3 panels in a grid at `lg+`, single column on mobile."

6. "Design a gift-card tile — card radius matches `12px`, fills with an illustrated photograph (hand-drawn watercolor-painted feel) as the entire surface. Subtle drop shadow makes it feel like a physical card on the cream canvas. Group under a category label ('Spring', 'Thank You', 'Birthday') in SoDoSans 24px weight 400 above the grid."

7. "Create a Starbucks product-detail header — House Green (`#1E3932`) band with breadcrumb 'Menu / Refreshers / Pink Energy Drink' in 14/400 white above the product title in SoDoSans 32/700 uppercase white. Product photograph centered below title. Below photo: a 4-up size selector row — each cup-icon button shows a vertical cup silhouette, size name ('Tall' / 'Grande' / 'Venti' / 'Trenta') in 16/700 white, and fluid-ounce in 13/400 Text White Soft. Selected size wraps the cup icon in a `2px solid #00754A` circular ring."

8. "Build a Starbucks customize flow — under the size selector, 3 stacked outlined-rectangle input rows (white bg, `1px solid #d6dbde` border, `4px` radius). Each has a floating label ('Add-ins', 'Milk', 'Add-ins') above the top border in 13/700 Text Black uppercase. Value centered (e.g., 'Ice', 'Coconut'). Right side: chevron-down in Text Black Soft. For the scoop row, embed a numeric stepper (`−` `1` `+` with circular `32px` outlined buttons). Below all three fields: outlined green 'Customize' pill with gold sparkle icon, `50px` radius, `14px 40px` padding. Pair with a Green Accent filled 'Add to Order' pill in the same row."

9. "Design a Starbucks product description band — full-width House Green (`#1E3932`) below product header. Top: a gold-outlined '200★ item' Rewards Cost Pill (`50px` radius, `4px 12px` padding, gold `#cba258` border and text). Below: product description in white 16/400/1.5. Nutritional inline summary in white 14/700 ('140 calories, 25g sugar, 2.5g fat') with info-icon tooltip. Outlined-white-on-green pill button 'Full nutrition &amp; ingredients list'. 32px vertical padding."

10. "Create a Starbucks nutrition facts table — two-column layout inside a White card. Left column: 'Ingredients' header (24/400 Text Black), followed by ingredient list or 'Not available for this item' placeholder paragraph in 14/400 Text Black Soft. Right column: 'Nutrition' header, then label/value rows (nutrient name left, value right) separated by `1px solid #e7e7e7` hairlines. Typography: labels in 14/400 Text Black, values in 14/700 Text Black right-aligned. Footnote asterisk markers in 13/400 Text Black Soft at the bottom."

### Iteration Guide

When refining existing screens generated with this design system:
1. Focus on ONE component at a time
2. Reference specific color names and hex codes from this document
3. Use natural language descriptions ("warm cream canvas," "four-tier green system") alongside exact values
4. Preserve the 50px pill + `scale(0.95)` active state universally
5. Check that greens are mapped to their correct role (Green Accent for CTA, Starbucks Green for heading, House Green for band)
6. Don't introduce gradients — the system is color-block
7. Keep SoDoSans tracking at `-0.01em` / `-0.16px` across the board

### Known Gaps

- SoDoSans is a proprietary typeface not available on Google Fonts — when implementing publicly, use Inter or Manrope as a substitute and document the swap
- Lander Tall (Rewards serif) is also custom — substitute with Iowan Old Style, Lora, or Source Serif Pro
- Specific per-component animation timings beyond the few documented (`--duration: 0.4s`, `--iconTransition: all ease-out 0.2s`, `--expanderDuration: 300ms`) are not captured for every interactive surface
- Form error-state full styling (red border weight, icon placement) visible on the tint token but not exhaustively extracted
- Careers-page specific components (cup-name card, search radio grid) are referenced in token names but not covered by this extraction
- Starbucks Visa Card / Starbucks-Card (SVC) detailed mockup specs are hinted at by `--svcRoundedCorners` and `--svcShadowFilter` tokens but not fully documented
