## Severity Guide

| Level | Icon | When to use | Blocks merge? |
|-------|------|-------------|---------------|
| Critical | 🔴 | Security vulnerabilities, data loss risk, crashes, broken core functionality | Yes |
| Warning | ⚠️ | Bugs in non-critical paths, missing error handling, missing tests for new code | Usually yes |
| Suggestion | 💡 | Style improvements, refactoring ideas, performance hints, documentation gaps | No |
| Looks Good | ✅ | Clean patterns, good test coverage, clear naming, smart design decisions | N/A |

## Verdict Decision

- **Approved ✅** — Zero critical/warning items. Only suggestions or all clear.
- **Changes Requested 🔴** — Any critical or warning item exists.
- **Reviewed 💬** — Observations only (draft PRs, uncertain findings, informational).

## For Inline Comments

Prefix inline comments with the severity icon so they're scannable:

```
🔴 **Critical:** User input passed directly to SQL query — use parameterized queries to prevent injection.
```

```
⚠️ **Warning:** This error is silently swallowed. At minimum, log it.
```

```
💡 **Suggestion:** This could be simplified with a dict comprehension:
`{k: v for k, v in items if v is not None}`
```

```
✅ **Nice:** Good use of context manager here — ensures cleanup on exceptions.
```

## For Local (Pre-Push) Review

When reviewing locally before push, use the same structure but present it as a message to the user instead of a PR comment. Skip the PR metadata header and just start with the severity sections.
