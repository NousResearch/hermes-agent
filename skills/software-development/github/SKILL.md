# GitHub

Work GitHub end to end with the `gh` CLI (REST fallback where noted): auth,
issues, the PR lifecycle, issue-to-PR delivery, code review, and repo
management. Each of the six workflows remains complete in its own reference;
standalone GitHub skills remain separate, with no absorption or deletion.
ALWAYS read the matching reference before starting that workflow; the body below
only routes.

## Routing

| Task | Read first |
|---|---|
| Auth broken / new machine / token or SSH setup / gh login | `references/auth.md` |
| Create, triage, label, assign, close issues | `references/issues.md` |
| Branch, commit, open PR, watch CI, merge | `references/pr-workflow.md` |
| Carry an ISSUE to a verified PR (full delivery loop) | `references/issue-to-pr.md` |
| Review someone's PR: diffs, inline comments, verdict | `references/code-review.md` |
| Clone/create/fork repos, remotes, releases | `references/repo-management.md` |

Supporting assets: [`scripts/gh-env.sh`](scripts/gh-env.sh) is the safe bundled
authentication detector. The installed `github-auth/scripts/gh-env.sh` remains
the canonical helper when that standalone skill is present. Git-store detection
is presence-only: it never supplies a PAT for API calls.
[`scripts/git-credential-token.py`](scripts/git-credential-token.py) is a legacy,
operator-only extraction utility, not an agent route; agents must never invoke
it or read credential-store values. Keep it for explicit human maintenance only.
`templates/` (PR bodies, bug report, feature request),
`references/ci-troubleshooting.md`, `references/conventional-commits.md`,
`references/github-api-cheatsheet.md`, `references/review-output-template.md`.

## Core discipline (applies to every workflow)

- Authentication and secret entry are user-only interactive steps. Never
  receive or print credentials, embed them in URLs/command text, extract them
  from Git's store, or write raw gh credential files. Use existing `gh` auth or
  a preconfigured environment token; see `references/auth.md` for setup.
- Preflight once per session: `gh auth status` — if it fails, go to
  `references/auth.md` before anything else.
- Prefer `gh` over raw REST; drop to `gh api` only for endpoints the
  porcelain lacks (the cheatsheet lists them).
- Never report CI green without checking `gh pr checks` yourself; never
  claim merged without verifying `state,mergedAt`.
- Read full context before writing: `gh issue view --comments` /
  `gh pr view --comments` — decisions live in threads, not titles.
- Sweep for duplicates before creating anything:
  `gh pr list --search` / `gh issue list --search`.

## Verification

- The workflow's own reference file defines done for that task.
- Cross-cutting: every claim about remote state (CI, merge, release,
  issue state) is backed by a fresh `gh` read, never memory.
