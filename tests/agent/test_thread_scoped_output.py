"""Tests for agent.thread_scoped_output.thread_scoped_silence.

Behaviour contract: a thread inside ``thread_scoped_silence()`` has its
stdout/stderr routed to devnull, while every OTHER thread keeps writing to the
real stream — even concurrently, while the first thread is still inside the
context.  This is the property the old process-global
``contextlib.redirect_stdout(devnull)`` violated (issue #55769 / #55925).
