"""Regression test for the jobs.json cross-process lock.

Background: ``hermes cron pause`` runs in its own process (CLI → cronjob tool →
``pause_job`` → ``update_job`` → ``save_jobs``), entirely separate from the
gateway process that also writes ``jobs.json`` (``mark_job_run`` /
``advance_next_run`` / due-fast-forward). The module's ``threading.Lock`` only
serializes writers *inside one process*, so a CLI pause issued while the gateway
was live could be silently lost to a concurrent gateway write — the job kept
firing even though the CLI reported "Paused".

``_jobs_lock()`` closes that gap with a short-held cross-process advisory file
lock. This test proves the lock actually excludes a *separate process*, which an
in-process ``threading.Lock`` cannot do. It covers POSIX ``fcntl`` and Windows
``msvcrt`` backends.
