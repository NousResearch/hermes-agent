"""Characterization tests for the cron trigger before/after the provider refactor.

These lock the CURRENT in-process-ticker contract (Phase 0 of the pluggable
CronScheduler plan, .hermes/plans/cron-scheduler-provider-interface.md). They
must pass unchanged on `main` now, and after every subsequent phase of the
refactor — they are the regression harness that proves the built-in firing
behavior is byte-for-byte preserved when the ticker is moved behind the
CronScheduler provider interface.

No production code is exercised beyond the two ticker entry points:
  - gateway/run.py::_start_cron_ticker        (production gateway ticker)
  - hermes_cli/web_server.py::_start_desktop_cron_ticker  (desktop fallback)

Both call `cron.scheduler.tick(...)` on a loop and exit when their stop_event
is set. We patch `cron.scheduler.tick` (both tickers import it locally as
`cron_tick`, so the module-attribute patch is observed) and assert the loop
drives it and stops promptly.
