"""Tests for the extracted GatewayKanbanWatchersMixin (god-file Phase 3).

The kanban watcher loops were lifted out of gateway/run.py into a mixin that
GatewayRunner inherits. These tests confirm the mixin exposes the methods and
that GatewayRunner picks them up via the MRO (behavior-neutral relocation).
