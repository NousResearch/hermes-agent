"""``GET /api/health`` ``commit`` contract (review G4).

The public health probe reports the backend's BOOT ``commit`` so an attaching client can refuse a
backend whose boot commit differs from its checkout: a ``serve`` that outlived ``hermes update``
is never re-adopted. The field must always be present
(``null`` off git) and must come from ``get_version_info().commit``.
