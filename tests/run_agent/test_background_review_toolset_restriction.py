"""Tests that the background review agent restricts tools at runtime, not at schema time.

Regression coverage for issue #15204 (the background skill-review agent must
not perform non-skill side effects like terminal, send_message, delegate_task)
combined with issue #25322 / PR #17276 (the review fork must hit the parent's
Anthropic/OpenRouter prefix cache).

Reconciling the two: the fork now inherits the parent's full ``tools`` schema
so the cache-key matches, and enforces the memory+skills restriction at
runtime via a thread-local whitelist on the existing
``get_pre_tool_call_block_message`` gate. Safety is preserved mechanically
(any non-whitelisted dispatch is blocked) without the schema-level narrowing
that caused the prefix-cache miss.
