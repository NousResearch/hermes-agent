"""Self-test for the live-system guard fixture in tests/conftest.py.

This file is the canary. If anyone removes a guard or weakens it, these
tests fail. If anyone adds a NEW kill primitive to the codebase without
adding it to the guard, the corresponding test added here will fail too.

The guard exists to protect the developer's live ``hermes-gateway`` process
from being SIGTERMed by tests. See PR #23397 for the original incident
(5+ live gateway kills in 3 days). Per Teknium 2026-05-10:

  > "You better do such a deep scan and scrub of the tests that this
  >  never is possible ever again for all eternity."

Every primitive that can deliver a signal to a foreign process or mutate
the live systemd unit MUST be exercised below. Adding a new primitive to
the guard? Add a test here too.

# This file executes REAL kill primitives — os.kill(-1, SIGTERM), os.killpg,

# fail-OPEN: in any collection context where this file is present but its home
# conftest is not, the primitives fire for real and ``os.kill(-1, SIGTERM)``
# SIGTERMs every process the invoking user owns (a full desktop-session kill was
# reported in the field — see issue #68311). Such contexts are not exotic:
# published sdists that ship ``tests/`` but not ``tests/conftest.py``, trees
# assembled by copying ``test*.py`` files (that glob does NOT match
# ``conftest.py``), ``pytest --noconftest``, or running from a foreign rootdir.
#
# The fixture below makes the canary fail-CLOSED instead: it refuses to run any
# test in this file unless the guard is provably active, so no collection
# context can ever detonate the primitives. The one thing the canary can detect
# about its own safety is that the guard monkeypatches ``os.kill`` with a plain
# Python function, whereas the unguarded primitive is a C builtin.
