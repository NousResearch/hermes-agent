# Do not put the pins in two places written by hand. That was #31817: the

# table in tools/lazy_deps.py — and they silently drifted more than once: the
# aiohttp Slack pin (3.13.3 vs 3.13.4) and the anthropic pin (0.86.0 vs
# 0.87.0). The version a user ended up with depended on whether the backend
# was installed eagerly or lazily, which for a one-sided CVE bump is a latent
# security regression.
#
# lazy_deps now READS the extras, so there is one source of truth and that
# particular drift can't recur. These tests keep the surrounding invariants:
# pyproject must be internally consistent, and the pins a lazy feature
# resolves must be present on every mirrored install path.
