"""Regression tests for _wait_for_process subprocess cleanup on exception exit.

When the poll loop exits via KeyboardInterrupt or SystemExit (SIGTERM via
cli.py signal handler, SIGINT on the main thread in non-interactive -q mode,
or explicit sys.exit from some caller), the child subprocess must be killed
before the exception propagates — otherwise the local backend's use of
os.setsid leaves an orphan with PPID=1.

The live repro that motivated this: hermes chat -q ... 'sleep 300', SIGTERM
to the python process, sleep 300 survived with PPID=1 for the full 300 s
because _wait_for_process never got to call _kill_process before python
died.  See commit message for full context.
