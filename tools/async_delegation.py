"""
Async (background) delegation registry.

Backs ``delegate_task(background=true)``: the parent agent dispatches a
subagent that runs on a module-level daemon executor and returns a handle
immediately, so the user and the model can keep working while the child runs.

When the child finishes, a completion event is pushed onto the SHARED
``process_registry.completion_queue`` with ``type="async_delegation"``. The
CLI (``cli.py`` process_loop) and gateway (``_run_process_watcher`` /
``completion_queue`` drain) already poll that queue while the agent is idle
and forge a fresh user/internal turn from each event. We deliberately reuse
that rail rather than reaching into a running agent loop:

  - completions surface as a NEW turn when the agent is idle, never spliced
    between a tool result and an assistant message. That keeps strict
    message-role alternation legal and the prompt cache intact (hard
    invariant: never mutate past context).
  - we inherit the queue's de-dup, crash-recovery checkpoint, and the
    existing CLI + gateway drain wiring for free — no new drain loops in the
    two largest files in the repo.

The completion payload carries a RICH, self-contained task-source block (the
original goal, the context the parent supplied, toolsets, model, dispatch
time, status, and the full result summary). When the result re-enters the
conversation the parent may be deep in unrelated context and won't remember
why the subagent existed; the block lets it either use the result or
re-dispatch if the world has moved on.

This module owns ONLY the async lifecycle. The actual child build + run is
delegated back to ``delegate_tool._run_single_child`` via an injected
runner, so all the credential leasing, heartbeat, timeout, and result-shaping
logic stays in one place.

    Parameters
    ----------
    goal, context, toolsets, role, model
        The dispatch-time task spec, captured verbatim for the rich
        completion block.
    session_key
        The gateway session_key (from ``tools.approval.get_current_session_key``)
        captured on the parent thread BEFORE dispatch, because the daemon
        worker thread won't carry the contextvar. Used to route the
        completion back to the originating session.
    parent_session_id
        The durable ``state.db`` session id of the parent agent that spawned
        the delegation. Carried on the completion event so the gateway can
        pin routing to the spawning session instead of recovering the latest
        ``ended_at IS NULL`` row for the peer tuple (#57498).
    runner
        Zero-arg callable that builds + runs the child and returns the same
        result dict ``_run_single_child`` produces. Runs on the worker thread.
    interrupt_fn
        Optional callable to signal the child to stop (used on shutdown /
        explicit cancel).
    progress_fn
        Optional zero-arg callable returning ``(token, in_tool)`` where
        ``token`` is any comparable snapshot of the child's progress (api
        call count + current tool) and ``in_tool`` says whether the child is
        currently inside a tool call. Sampled by the stale monitor; a frozen
        token past the stale threshold marks the delegation stuck (see the
        stale-detection block at the top of this module). When omitted, the
        delegation is not monitored.
    max_async_children
        Concurrency cap. When at capacity the dispatch is REJECTED (the caller
        should fall back to sync or tell the user) rather than queued, so a
        runaway model can't pile up unbounded background work.
