"""Read-only view of one bot's unsettled ``message_agent`` deliveries to local teammates.

The receipts already exist: every local delivery the sender's ``message_agent`` admits lands in
the TARGET profile's ``runtime/bot_live_delivery/<id>.json``, stamped ``author.id ==
"bot:<sender>"`` (``tools/bot_mode_dm.py``). This module only reads them, so the sender's Bot
Chat can show what each teammate is doing with the request: still queued, working on it, parked
on a question only the user can answer, or failed. Nothing here writes, claims, cancels or resends
a delivery — an outcome this reader cannot see is reported as unknown, never retried.
