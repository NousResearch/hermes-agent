Clarify Tool Module - Interactive Clarifying Questions

Allows the agent to present structured multiple-choice questions or open-ended
prompts to the user. In CLI mode, choices are navigable with arrow keys. On
messaging platforms, choices are rendered as a numbered list.

The actual user-interaction logic lives in the platform layer (cli.py for CLI,
gateway/run.py for messaging). This module defines the schema, validation, and
a thin dispatcher that delegates to a platform-provided callback.

    The schema declares choices as bare strings, but LLMs sometimes emit
    dict-shaped choices like ``[{"description": "..."}]``. A naive ``str(c)``
    turns the whole dict into its Python repr — ``{'description': '...'}`` —
    which then leaks onto every surface that renders the choice (CLI panel,
    Discord buttons, Telegram numbered list) AND is returned verbatim as the
    user's answer. Normalising here, at the one platform-agnostic entry point,
    fixes the whole class in one place instead of per-adapter.

    Dict unwrap order is the canonical LLM tool-call user-facing keys:
    ``label`` → ``description`` → ``text`` → ``title``. ``name`` and ``value``
    are deliberately excluded — they're component-shaped fields that could
    carry raw enum values or short identifiers, not human-readable labels. A
    dict with none of the canonical keys is dropped (returns ""), since a
    garbage label is worse than no choice at all.
