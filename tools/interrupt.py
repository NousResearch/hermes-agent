"""Per-thread interrupt signaling for all tools.

Provides thread-scoped interrupt tracking so that interrupting one agent
session does not kill tools running in other sessions.  This is critical
in the gateway where multiple agents run concurrently in the same process.

The agent stores its execution thread ID at the start of run_conversation()
and passes it to set_interrupt()/clear_interrupt().  Tools call
is_interrupted() which checks the CURRENT thread — no argument needed.

Usage in tools:
    from tools.interrupt import is_interrupted
    if is_interrupted():
        return {"output": "[interrupted]", "returncode": 130}
