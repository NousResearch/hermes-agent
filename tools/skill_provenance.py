"""Skill write-origin provenance — ContextVar for generated skill writes.

The curator treats generated skills as system-managed sediment. Skills a user
asks a foreground agent to write still belong to the user, but automated
review loops such as background review and Codex learning need durable origin
provenance so generated skills can be audited and curated.

This module exposes a ContextVar that run_agent.py sets before each tool
loop so tool handlers (e.g. skill_manage create) can check whether they
are executing inside the background-review fork.

The signal piggybacks on AIAgent._memory_write_origin, which is already
set to "background_review" for review-fork instances (see
_spawn_background_review in run_agent.py) and defaults to "assistant_tool"
for normal (foreground) agents.

Usage:
    from tools.skill_provenance import (
        set_current_write_origin,
        reset_current_write_origin,
        get_current_write_origin,
    )

    token = set_current_write_origin("background_review")
    try:
        ...  # tool runs here
    finally:
        reset_current_write_origin(token)

    # inside a tool:
    if is_curator_managed_origin():
        mark_agent_created(skill_name)
