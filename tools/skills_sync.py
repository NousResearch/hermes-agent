"""
Skills Sync -- Manifest-based seeding and updating of bundled skills.

Copies bundled skills from the repo's skills/ directory into ~/.hermes/skills/
and uses a manifest to track which skills have been synced and their origin hash.

Manifest format (v2): each line is "skill_name:origin_hash" where origin_hash
is the MD5 of the bundled skill at the time it was last synced to the user dir.
Old v1 manifests (plain names without hashes) are auto-migrated.

Update logic:
  - NEW skills (not in manifest): copied to user dir, origin hash recorded.
  - EXISTING skills (in manifest, present in user dir):
      * If user copy matches origin hash: user hasn't modified it → safe to
        update from bundled if bundled changed. New origin hash recorded.
      * If user copy differs from origin hash: user customized it → SKIP.
  - DELETED by user (in manifest, absent from user dir): respected, not re-added.
  - REMOVED from bundled (in manifest, gone from repo): cleaned from manifest.

The manifest lives at ~/.hermes/skills/.bundled_manifest.
