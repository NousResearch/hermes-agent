# Telegram Setup

Hermes Agent integrates with Telegram as a full-featured conversational bot. Once connected, you can chat with your agent from any device, send voice memos that get auto-transcribed, receive scheduled task results, and use the agent in group chats. The integration is built on [python-telegram-bot](https://python-telegram-bot.org/) and supports text, voice, images, and file attachments.

## Step 1: Create a Bot via BotFather

Every Telegram bot requires an API token issued by [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather), Telegram's official bot management tool.

1. Open Telegram and search for **@BotFather**, or visit [t.me/BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
2. Send `/newbot`
3. Choose a **display name** (e.g., "Hermes Agent") — this can be anything
4. Choose a **username** — this must be unique and end in `bot` (e.g., `my_hermes_bot`)
5. BotFather replies with your **API token**. It looks like this:

```
123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrSTUvwxYZ
```

:::warning
Keep your bot token secret. Anyone with this token can control your bot. If it leaks, revoke it immediately via `/revoke` in BotFather.
:::

## Step 2: Customize Your Bot (Optional)

These BotFather commands improve the user experience. Message @BotFather and use:

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/setdescription` | The "What can this bot do?" text shown before a user starts chatting |
| `/setabouttext` | Short text on the bot's profile page |
| `/setuserpic` | Upload an avatar for your bot |
| `/setcommands` | Define the command menu (the `/` button in chat) |
| `/setprivacy` | Control whether the bot sees all group messages (see Step 3) |

:::tip
For `/setcommands`, a useful starting set:

```
help - Show help information
new - Start a new conversation
sethome - Set this chat as the home channel
```
:::

## Step 3: Privacy Mode (Critical for Groups)

Telegram bots have a **privacy mode** that is **enabled by default**. This is the single most common source of confusion when using bots in groups.

**With privacy mode ON**, your bot can only see:
- Messages that start with a `/` command
- Replies directly to the bot's own messages
- Service messages (member joins/leaves, pinned messages, etc.)
- Messages in channels where the bot is an admin

**With privacy mode OFF**, the bot receives every message in the group.

### How to disable privacy mode

1. Message **@BotFather**
2. Send `/mybots`
3. Select your bot
4. Go to **Bot Settings → Group Privacy → Turn off**

:::warning
**You must remove and re-add the bot to any group** after changing the privacy setting. Telegram caches the privacy state when a bot joins a group, and it will not update until the bot is removed and re-added.
:::

:::tip
An alternative to disabling privacy mode: promote the bot to **group admin**. Admin bots always receive all messages regardless of the privacy setting, and this avoids needing to toggle the global privacy mode.
:::

## Step 4: Find Your User ID

Hermes Agent uses numeric Telegram user IDs to control access. Your user ID is **not** your username — it's a number like `123456789`.

**Method 1 (recommended):** Message [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) — it instantly replies with your user ID.

**Method 2:** Message [@get_id_bot](https://t.me/get_id_bot) — another reliable option.

Save this number; you'll need it for the next step.

## Step 5: Configure Hermes

### Option A: Interactive Setup (Recommended)

```bash
hermes gateway setup
```

Select **Telegram** when prompted. The wizard asks for your bot token and allowed user IDs, then writes the configuration for you.

### Option B: Manual Configuration

Add the following to `~/.hermes/.env`:

```bash
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrSTUvwxYZ
TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS=123456789    # Comma-separated for multiple users
```

### Start the Gateway

```bash
hermes gateway
```

The bot should come online within seconds. Send it a message on Telegram to verify.

## Home Channel

Use the `/sethome` command in any Telegram chat (DM or group) to designate it as the **home channel**. Scheduled tasks (cron jobs) deliver their results to this channel.

You can also set it manually in `~/.hermes/.env`:

```bash
TELEGRAM_HOME_CHANNEL=-1001234567890
TELEGRAM_HOME_CHANNEL_NAME="My Notes"
```

:::tip
Group chat IDs are negative numbers (e.g., `-1001234567890`). Your personal DM chat ID is the same as your user ID.
:::

## Voice Messages

### Incoming Voice (Speech-to-Text)

Voice messages you send on Telegram are automatically transcribed by Hermes's configured STT provider and injected as text into the conversation.

- `local` uses `faster-whisper` on the machine running Hermes — no API key required
- `groq` uses Groq Whisper and requires `GROQ_API_KEY`
- `openai` uses OpenAI Whisper and requires `VOICE_TOOLS_OPENAI_KEY`

### Outgoing Voice (Text-to-Speech)

When the agent generates audio via TTS, it's delivered as native Telegram **voice bubbles** — the round, inline-playable kind.

- **OpenAI and ElevenLabs** produce Opus natively — no extra setup needed
- **Edge TTS** (the default free provider) outputs MP3 and requires **ffmpeg** to convert to Opus:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install ffmpeg

# macOS
brew install ffmpeg
```

Without ffmpeg, Edge TTS audio is sent as a regular audio file (still playable, but uses the rectangular player instead of a voice bubble).

Configure the TTS provider in your `config.yaml` under the `tts.provider` key.

## Group Chat Usage

Hermes Agent works in Telegram group chats with a few considerations:

- **Privacy mode** determines what messages the bot can see (see [Step 3](#step-3-privacy-mode-critical-for-groups))
- `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS` still applies — only authorized users can trigger the bot, even in groups
- You can keep the bot from responding to ordinary group chatter with `telegram.require_mention: true`
- With `telegram.require_mention: true`, group messages are accepted when they are:
  - slash commands
  - replies to one of the bot's messages
  - `@botusername` mentions
  - matches for one of your configured regex wake words in `telegram.mention_patterns`
- If `telegram.require_mention` is left unset or false, Hermes keeps the previous open-group behavior and responds to normal group messages it can see

### Example group trigger configuration

Add this to `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```yaml
telegram:
  require_mention: true
  mention_patterns:
    - "^\\s*chompy\\b"
```

This example allows all the usual direct triggers plus messages that begin with `chompy`, even if they do not use an `@mention`.

### Notes on `mention_patterns`

- Patterns use Python regular expressions
- Matching is case-insensitive
- Patterns are checked against both text messages and media captions
- Invalid regex patterns are ignored with a warning in the gateway logs rather than crashing the bot
- If you want a pattern to match only at the start of a message, anchor it with `^`

## Private Chat Topics (Bot API 9.4)

Telegram Bot API 9.4 (February 2026) introduced **Private Chat Topics** — bots can create forum-style topic threads directly in 1-on-1 DM chats, no supergroup needed. This lets you run multiple isolated workspaces within your existing DM with Hermes.

### Use case

If you work on several long-running projects, topics keep their context separate:

- **Topic "Website"** — work on your production web service
- **Topic "Research"** — literature review and paper exploration
- **Topic "General"** — miscellaneous tasks and quick questions

Each topic gets its own conversation session, history, and context — completely isolated from the others.

### Configuration

Add topics under `platforms.telegram.extra.dm_topics` in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```yaml
platforms:
  telegram:
    extra:
      dm_topics:
      - chat_id: 123456789        # Your Telegram user ID
        topics:
        - name: General
          icon_color: 7322096
        - name: Website
          icon_color: 9367192
        - name: Research
          icon_color: 16766590
          skill: arxiv              # Auto-load a skill in this topic
```

**Fields:**

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Topic display name |
| `icon_color` | No | Telegram icon color code (integer) |
| `icon_custom_emoji_id` | No | Custom emoji ID for the topic icon |
| `skill` | No | Skill to auto-load on new sessions in this topic |
| `thread_id` | No | Auto-populated after topic creation — don't set manually |

### How it works

1. On gateway startup, Hermes calls `createForumTopic` for each topic that doesn't have a `thread_id` yet
2. The `thread_id` is saved back to `config.yaml` automatically — subsequent restarts skip the API call
3. Each topic maps to an isolated session key: `agent:main:telegram:dm:{chat_id}:{thread_id}`
4. Messages in each topic have their own conversation history, memory flush, and context window

### Skill binding

Topics with a `skill` field automatically load that skill when a new session starts in the topic. This works exactly like typing `/skill-name` at the start of a conversation — the skill content is injected into the first message, and subsequent messages see it in the conversation history.

For example, a topic with `skill: arxiv` will have the arxiv skill pre-loaded whenever its session resets (due to idle timeout, daily reset, or manual `/reset`).

:::tip
Topics created outside of the config (e.g., by manually calling the Telegram API) are discovered automatically when a `forum_topic_created` service message arrives. You can also add topics to the config while the gateway is running — they'll be picked up on the next cache miss.
:::

## Recent Bot API Features

- **Bot API 9.4 (Feb 2026):** Private Chat Topics — bots can create forum topics in 1-on-1 DM chats via `createForumTopic`. See [Private Chat Topics](#private-chat-topics-bot-api-94) above.
- **Privacy policy:** Telegram now requires bots to have a privacy policy. Set one via BotFather with `/setprivacy_policy`, or Telegram may auto-generate a placeholder. This is particularly important if your bot is public-facing.
- **Message streaming:** Bot API 9.x added support for streaming long responses, which can improve perceived latency for lengthy agent replies.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Bot not responding at all | Verify `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` is correct. Check `hermes gateway` logs for errors. |
| Bot responds with "unauthorized" | Your user ID is not in `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS`. Double-check with @userinfobot. |
| Bot ignores group messages | Privacy mode is likely on. Disable it (Step 3) or make the bot a group admin. **Remember to remove and re-add the bot after changing privacy.** |
| Voice messages not transcribed | Verify STT is available: install `faster-whisper` for local transcription, or set `GROQ_API_KEY` / `VOICE_TOOLS_OPENAI_KEY` in `~/.hermes/.env`. |
| Voice replies are files, not bubbles | Install `ffmpeg` (needed for Edge TTS Opus conversion). |
| Bot token revoked/invalid | Generate a new token via `/revoke` then `/newbot` or `/token` in BotFather. Update your `.env` file. |

## Exec Approval

When the agent tries to run a potentially dangerous command, it asks you for approval in the chat:

> ⚠️ This command is potentially dangerous (recursive delete). Reply "yes" to approve.

Reply "yes"/"y" to approve or "no"/"n" to deny.

## Security

:::warning
Always set `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS` to restrict who can interact with your bot. Without it, the gateway denies all users by default as a safety measure.
:::

Never share your bot token publicly. If compromised, revoke it immediately via BotFather's `/revoke` command.

For more details, see the [Security documentation](/user-guide/security). You can also use [DM pairing](/user-guide/messaging#dm-pairing-alternative-to-allowlists) for a more dynamic approach to user authorization.
